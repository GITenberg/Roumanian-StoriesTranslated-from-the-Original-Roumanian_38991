<p><span class="sc">H.M. The Queen of Roumania</span></p>
<p>Very little is known in England about Roumanian literature, which
although not as rich as in many other countries, presents,
nevertheless, features of real interest.</p>
<p>Like all people in touch with the East, even the peasants have a
strain of poetry in their speech, their expression is picturesque and
gentle, an almost fatalistic note of sadness rings through all the
songs they sing.</p>
<p>Our poets have adapted themselves to this particular strain, and
mostly it is the popular form that has been developed by our literary
men both in prose and poetry.</p>
<p>Roumanian literature possesses eminent historians and critics. I am
not, in these few lines, going to touch upon their activities; but
strangely enough there are few writers of fiction amongst the
Roumanians&mdash;great novel writers do not exist.</p>
<p>The Roumanian, above all, excels as poet and as a short-story
writer. In this last art he is past-master, and it is therefore a great
pleasure to me to encourage this book which Mrs. Schomberg Byng
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e243" href="#xd19e243" name=
"xd19e243">viii</a>]</span>is sending out into the world at a moment
when I am so anxious that my country should be better known and
understood in England.</p>
<p>Each one of these short stories is a little work of art, and deeply
characteristic of Roumanian popular life and thought; therefore I have
no doubt that they will interest all those who care about
literature.</p>
<p>I feel personally indebted to Mrs. Schomberg Byng to have thought of
making this interesting feature of Roumanian literature known to the
British public. I therefore, with all my heart, wish this little volume
Good Luck.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By <span class="sc">Professor S. Mehedintzi</span><br>
Of Bucharest University and the Roumanian Academy</p>
<p>As regards poetry Roumanian literature had reached the European
level by the nineteenth century. Eminescu may be placed by the side of
Leopardi. The drama and the novel are still unrepresented by any works
of the first rank; but the short story shows that Roumanian writing is
constantly on the upward grade.</p>
<p>The following stories have been selected from many writers. The
reader must judge each author for himself. It is impossible to settle
their respective merits; that would presuppose an acquaintance with the
whole of Roumanian literature. We may, however, be allowed to say a
word or two about each writer.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Negruzzi is to Roumanian very much what Sir Walter Scott has been to
English literature. After the lapse of nigh a century the historical
novel is still identified with his name.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Creanga is a production exclusively Roumanian; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd19e280" href="#xd19e280" name=
"xd19e280">x</a>]</span>a peasant who knew no foreign tongue, but whose
mind was steeped in the fairy tales, proverbs, and wit of the people.
He wrote with a humour and an originality of imagery which make his
work almost impossible to translate into other languages.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Caragiale, our most noted dramatic author, is the antithesis of
Creanga; a man of culture, literary and artistic in the highest sense
of the word. <i>The Easter Torch</i> ranks him high among the great
short-story writers.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Popovici-Banatzeanu&mdash;dead very young&mdash;and
Bratescu-Voineshti are writers who more than any others give us the
atmosphere of the English novel in which the ethical note predominates.
Some of their pages have the poignancy of Dickens.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The same discreet note is struck by Slavici, born in Hungary, whose
<i>Popa Tanda</i> is the personification of the Roumanian people
subject for centuries to the injustice of an alien race, and driven to
seek support in their own work only.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Delavrancea, a famous orator, is a romantic; while Sadoveanu, the
most fertile prose writer among the younger men, possesses as novelist
and story-teller a touch which makes him akin to Turgenev and
Sienkiewicz.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Beza stands by himself. From the mountains of Macedonia he brings
into the national literature <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e308"
href="#xd19e308" name="xd19e308">xi</a>]</span>the original note of the
life of the shepherds in the Balkans. Constantly upon the road, among
mountain tops and plains, always in fear of the foreigners among whom
they pass, their life manifests a great spiritual concentration. Over
Beza&rsquo;s work there hover a mystery and a restraint which
completely fascinate the reader. Though young, he possesses the
qualities of the classical writers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd19e310" href="#xd19e310" name="xd19e310">xiii</a>]</span></p>

<h2 class="main">Translator&rsquo;s Note</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I wish to take this opportunity of thanking M. Beza
for his most valuable assistance. Without his intimate knowledge of the

would never have seen the light.</p>
<p>Some well-known names, that of Diuliu Zamfirescu for instance, are
absent from my list of authors; lack of time and difficulty in

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By M. Sadoveanu</span></p>
<p>One evening old Costescu told us an adventure of his youth.</p>
<p>The old mill of Zavu, he began, stands to this day close to the
Popricani lake. A black building leaning towards the dark waters. The
six wheels are driven by great streams of water which come rushing
through the mill-race, and surround the house, washing through the
cracks. Above the boiling foam which encircles it, the great building
shakes with the unceasing roar of the water.</p>
<p>So it is to-day; so it was at the period when I used to roam about
those parts&mdash;it is long, long, since then.</p>
<p>I remember a night like a night in a fairy tale, full of the silver
light of the moon, a night when only youth could see, when only youth
could feel.</p>
<p>It was in July. I was descending the lake by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>myself with
my gun over my shoulder. Flights of duck passing above the forest of
reeds lured me on. I followed their rapid flight through the clear
atmosphere, the black specks became gradually smaller until they were
lost to sight in the rosy clouds of the setting sun. I passed above the
weir, where the waterfall brawls, between the bushy willow-trees which
guard the narrow path, and approached the mill. The green stream swept
through the mill-race, the foaming water boiled round the black
building, and in the yard, unyoked and ruminating, the oxen slept
beside the waggon.</p>
<p>The old man, the miller, the great-grandson of Zavu, descended from
the mill bridge with his pipe in the corner of his mouth. In the
deafening roar of the water and the creaking of the wheels men waited
in silence amid the luminous spray that filled the old building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good health to you, my old friend Simione!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. How goes it with the land? Grinding good
flour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the old man&rsquo;s usual question: was the country
grinding good flour?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, my old friend Simione!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise be to God!&rdquo; said the old fellow. &ldquo;But how
are you, sir? You never come to see us. The duck give you no
peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they give me no peace. I mean to lie in wait on the bank
to-night. Perhaps luck will come my way.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good; may it be as you wish. See, Zamfira will show you the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment appeared the miller&rsquo;s niece. She was a
strange girl of sixteen years of age; of middle height and thin, but
with well-developed muscles: her cheeks were sunburnt, and she had two
grey eyes, eyes so restless and so strange, and of such beauty and such
brilliance as I have never seen since. She had not regular features,
but the grey eyes beneath the heavy, arched brows gave her an unusual
and radiant beauty.</p>
<p>At the old man&rsquo;s words she stopped suddenly, and said quickly
with twinkling eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to show him the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked with surprise, while the old man
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo; said Zamfira, looking
at me askance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man quietly,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t take him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at me searchingly, through half-closed eyelids, and
then cried sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Simione began to laugh softly, turned round, and pursued his way
to the mill bridge, but Zamfira remained in front of me, erect, her
hands by her sides. Her head was bent down, but the grey eyes flashed
at me from beneath the eyebrows. Her head was bare, her chestnut hair
was drawn smoothly back from the temples into a thick plait,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>tied at the nape of the neck; a white water-lily,
beautiful, as though cut out of silver, was fastened among her rich
tresses. Beneath a white chemise her bosom rose and fell, a blue skirt
fell plainly to her ankles.</p>
<p>Suddenly she raised her head and looked shyly at me as she smiled.
Her teeth shone between her thin lips. Then, with her eyes, she gave me
the signal: &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed her. She moved swiftly; her well-developed form was
clearly outlined beneath her thin garments. From time to time she
turned her head, and her teeth flashed. She untied the boat, jumped in
and said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I was seated, she braced herself for the effort, thrust in the
long pole, and set the boat in motion. For some time we glided through
reeds and rushes, and above great beds of weed. When we reached open
water she put down the pole, and took to the oars. The boat cleft the
deep water which glowed with flames from the fire of the setting sun.
The oars splashed softly with a musical sound. The girl&rsquo;s whole
body moved with a rhythmic grace that was unspeakably fascinating. The
silver lily quivered in the luxuriant chestnut hair.</p>
<p>Silence reigned over the lake. Water-lilies shone in the golden
sunset; the reeds rustled softly; the dragon-flies passed like blue
flashes through the light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>Suddenly the girl turned her strange grey eyes upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So to-night you will lie in wait for the duck?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice had a melodious, silvery ring. I questioned her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems strange to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, turning her head away; &ldquo;but
aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what should I be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the fairy of the lake,&rdquo; she replied with
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the water lady? Who is this fairy of the lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Do you not know? The fairy of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes scanned my face intently.</p>
<p>The sun had nearly set; the water of the lake grew dark; a heron
passed above us scarcely moving its wings; its cries sent a shudder of
sadness through the silence of the forest of reeds. The girl looked at
me, and her teeth shone with a smile of almost diabolical beauty: her
clear-cut face seemed to reflect the colour of the green water. I
cannot describe what I felt; only the <i>charm</i> of the speaker was
astounding. In that framework of reeds and creepers&mdash;set as it
were between two skies&mdash;<i>she</i> was the fairy of the lake.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>The boat struck the side of a cave and remained fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>Slowly I stepped ashore. But the charm made my head reel. I turned
abruptly, took her face between my hands, and would have kissed those
eyes in whose depths the secret of the lake lay hid. She resisted
gracefully with little movements, and trills of laughter, and instead
of kissing her eyes I touched her lips which burnt like fire.</p>
<p>I felt her draw herself away, I felt those strange eyes piercing
through me, and the boat shot away into the reeds and creepers. The
lake remained desolate, and in the silence only the gentle splash of
distant oars could be heard. I prepared myself a little bed of reeds in
the cave. I spread out my serge cloak, tried the triggers of my gun,
and while I waited for the duck I fell into a brown study. How strange!
I was perfectly conscious of my position; I knew quite well that the
fairy was none other than Zamfira, the miller&rsquo;s niece, the
sunburnt, and perhaps, the simple maiden; and in spite of this, the
eyes, and the laughter, had something about them that intoxicated me
like the strong perfume of some wild flower.</p>
<p>In the gradually deepening shadows of the twilight she remained like
some vision, floating on the bosom of the lake, among the blossoms of
the water-lilies. I was roused by the rapid whirr of wings. I started
up. A flight of duck passed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href=
"#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>over me. This event drove away my
preoccupation. I steadied the gun in my hands and put it at full cock.
In the reeds, torn and beaten by the wings of the duck, coot and
moor-hens called to each other; a light breeze ruffled the forest of
reeds. Small flocks of birds passed through the darkness of the night.
I fired a few shots. The gun made a deep sound which echoed far across
the water; one or two duck detached themselves from the group, and fell
heavily to the surface of the lake, troubling the water. The darkness
increased, it was impossible to distinguish the duck, one could only
hear the rustle of their flight, like a brief wind. The evening breeze
dropped, and a calm spread itself over the lake: only great black birds
flew overhead, noisily crying: &ldquo;Chaw! Chaw!&rdquo; From time to
time, in the silence of the night, could be heard the deep, lugubrious,
indistinct note of the bittern.</p>
<p>Stars glowed overhead, and in the depths of the water&mdash;the moon
would not rise for nearly another hour. I wrapped myself in my cloak,
and began to ponder over those grey eyes. In the silence, which grew
ever deeper, the noise of the mill and of the weir could be heard afar
off; somewhere a dog barked in its kennel; from some hill, lighting the
darkness, one caught the twinkle of a bright flame. The supple body,
the eyes, and the laughter, the lily blossom which harmonized so well
with the lake and with the green lights in the eyes, tantalized me. Now
she was no longer the simple maiden, kissed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>by the sun
and caressed by the wind; every movement, every look, had something
particular about it. And also something strange.</p>
<p>I had never seen her when I visited the mill. I had heard of the old
man&rsquo;s devilish niece, but I had never set eyes upon her. But now
an incident recurred to my mind, to which, at the time, I had paid
scant attention. On one occasion I had perceived a pair of restless
eyes peeping at me through a chink in the mill bridge. Those eyes were
surely hers; they sparkled so&mdash;and were so full of light and
mirth. There, in the dark night, that ardent kiss seemed to burn me and
I waited&mdash;I waited for something that I could not explain even to
myself.</p>
<p>I dozed, dreaming of those grey eyes. I cannot tell&mdash;perhaps I
fell asleep. I awoke in the full light of the moon which was flooding
atmosphere and lake with its silver beams. The water glittered, the
night was still, the mill was silent; in the distance the weir was
murmuring as in a dream.</p>
<p>Here and there, the water rippled into circles the colour of agate;
groups of duck were bathing in the moonlight. I put my hand to my gun.
I raised my eyes, I was ready to pull&mdash;when I paused. A melodious
song, scarcely intelligible, could be heard coming from the lake. It
was a simple song, and monotonous, but its remoteness, the echo across
the water, the clear light of the moon, lent it a profound charm. I
immediately thought of the lady of the lake. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>I placed my gun beside me and listened. It was a simple and touching
melody. It had ceased for some time, but I still strained my ears; I
could only catch the soft murmur of the distant weir. Time passed, and
yet I still expected something to happen.</p>
<p>After a while I heard distinctly the soft splash of oars. I looked
everywhere, I could not make out whence it came. Then, suddenly, amid
the obscurity of the rushes, the gently floating boat came gliding into
the sea of light with the girl reclining in the silvery beams. The lily
shone in her dark hair.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you what I felt, for the storm of emotion cannot be
expressed in words, and besides that, I was young then, and half a
century has passed since my youth. I know I stood with wondering eyes
and gazed like one possessed: in very truth this was the fairy of the
lake!</p>
<p>All at once I saw a movement. The boat turned, and the oars struck
the water, making great ripples of light. It was directed towards my
cave. She came with wild speed, staring, her great eyes like
phosphorescent stars. But when she got near, she once more let the boat
glide, then turned abruptly, and laughing passed by the cave&mdash;a
silvery laugh, which I have never forgotten, no, not to this day
although it is so long ago. She passed by like a phantom, laughing, and
her eyes shining like two stars in the night of those great eyebrows.
To the right of me she rose, and threw something towards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>me;
then, sinking down, she again took the oars, struck the water, and shot
out into the open lake.</p>
<p>She disappeared. One could only hear the soft stroke of the oars;
then that, too, ceased, and perfect silence fell upon the silvery
lake.</p>
<p>By my side I found a bouquet of carnations and sweet basil, the
flowers of love.</p>
<p>At daybreak the old man came to take me off. When I turned towards
the yard I once again bent my head in the direction of the old black
building. Eyes watched me through the chink in the mill bridge.</p>
<p>That very day I went away. Many a time have I wanted to return to
the old Zavu mill, but fate has willed it otherwise. At last, when I
could have done so, other loves have held me in other places. Years
have passed, but the bunch of dried carnations and basil reminds me of
it all. And from time to time, my thoughts wander to the fairy of the
lake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=

<h2 class="main">The Easter Torch</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. L. Caragiale</span></p>
<p>Leiba Zibal, mine host of Podeni, was sitting lost in thought, by a
table placed in the shadow in front of the inn; he was awaiting the
arrival of the coach which should have come some time ago; it was
already an hour behind time.</p>
<p>The story of Zibal&rsquo;s life is a long and cheerless one: when he
is taken with one of his feverish attacks it is a diversion for him to
analyse one by one the most important events in that life.</p>
<p>Huckster, seller of hardware, jobber, between whiles even rougher
work perhaps, seller of old clothes, then tailor, and boot-black in a
dingy alley in Jassy; all this had happened to him since the accident
whereby he lost his situation as office boy in a big wine-shop. Two
porters were carrying a barrel down to a cellar under the supervision
of the lad Zibal. A difference arose between them as to the division of
their earnings. One of them seized a piece of wood that lay at hand and
struck his comrade on the forehead, who fell to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>ground
covered in blood. At the sight of the wild deed the boy gave a cry of
alarm, but the wretch hurried through the yard, and in passing gave the
lad a blow. Zibal fell to the ground fainting with fear. After several
months in bed he returned to his master, only to find his place filled
up. Then began a hard struggle for existence, which increased in
difficulty after his marriage with Sura. Their hard lot was borne with
patience. Sura&rsquo;s brother, the inn-keeper of Podeni, died; the inn
passed into Zibal&rsquo;s hands, and he carried on the business on his
own account.</p>
<p>Here he had been for the last five years. He had saved a good bit of
money and collected good wine&mdash;a commodity that will always be
worth good money&mdash;Leiba had escaped from poverty, but they were
all three sickly, himself, his wife, and his child, all victims of
malaria, and men are rough and quarrelsome in Podeni&mdash;slanderous,
scoffers, revilers, accused of vitriol throwing. And the threats! A
threat is very terrible to a character that bends easily beneath every
blow. The thought of a threat worked more upon Leiba&rsquo;s nerves
than did his attacks of fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wretched Gentile!&rdquo; he thought, sighing.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; referred to Gheorghe&mdash;wherever he
might be!&mdash;a man between whom and himself a most unpleasant affair
had arisen.</p>
<p>Gheorghe came to the inn one autumn morning, tired with his walk; he
was just out of hospital&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>so he said&mdash;and was looking
for work. The innkeeper took him into his service. But Gheorghe showed
himself to be a brutal and a sullen man. He swore continually, and
muttered to himself alone in the yard. He was a bad servant, lazy and
insolent, and he stole. He threatened his mistress one day when she was
pregnant, cursing her, and striking her on the stomach. Another time he
set a dog on little Strul.</p>
<p>Leiba paid him his wages at once, and dismissed him. But Gheorghe
would not go: he asserted with violence that he had been engaged for a
year. Then the innkeeper sent to the town hall to get guards to remove
him.</p>
<p>Gheorghe put his hand swiftly to his breast, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jew!&rdquo; and began to rail at his master. Unfortunately, a
cart full of customers arrived at that moment. Gheorghe began to grin,
saying: &ldquo;What frightened you, Master Leiba? Look, I am going
now.&rdquo; Then bending fiercely over the bar towards Leiba, who drew
back as far as possible, he whispered: &ldquo;Expect me on Easter Eve;
we&rsquo;ll crack red eggs together, Jew! You will know then what I
have done to you, and I will answer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, customers entered the inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we meet in good health at Easter, Master Leiba!&rdquo;
added Gheorghe as he left.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Leiba went to the town hall, then to the sub-prefecture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>to
denounce the threatener, begging that he might be watched. The
sub-prefect was a lively young man; he first accepted Leiba&rsquo;s
humble offering, then he began to laugh at the timid Jew, and make fun
of him. Leiba tried hard to make him realize the gravity of the
situation, and pointed out how isolated the house stood from the
village, and even from the high road. But the sub-prefect, with a more
serious air, advised him to be prudent; he must not mention such
things, for, truly, it would arouse the desire to do them in a village
where men were rough and poor, ready to break the law.</p>
<p>A few days later, an official with two riders came to see him about
Gheorghe; he was &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for some crime.</p>
<p>If only Leiba had been able to put up with him until the arrival of
these men! In the meanwhile, no one knew the whereabouts of Gheorghe.
Although this had happened some time ago, Gheorghe&rsquo;s appearance,
the movement as though he would have drawn something from his breast,
and the threatening words had all remained deeply impressed upon the
mind of the terror-stricken man. How was it that that memory remained
so clear?</p>
<p>It was Easter Eve.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill, from the village lying among the lakes
about two miles away, came the sound of church bells. One hears in a
strange way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>when one is feverish, now so loud, now so far
away. The coming night was the night before Easter, the night of the
fulfilment of Gheorghe&rsquo;s promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps they have caught him by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Zibal only means to stay at Podeni till next quarter-day.
With his capital he could open a good business in Jassy. In a town,
Leiba would regain his health, he would go near the police
station&mdash;he could treat the police, the commissionaires, the
sergeants. Who pays well gets well guarded.</p>
<p>In a large village, the night brings noise and light, not darkness
and silence as in the isolated valley of Podeni. There is an inn in
Jassy&mdash;there in the corner, just the place for a shop! An inn
where girls sing all night long, a Caf&eacute; Chantant. What a gay and
rousing life! There, at all hours of the day and night, officials and
their girls, and other dirty Christians will need entertainment.</p>
<p>What is the use of bothering oneself here where business keeps
falling off, especially since the coming of the railway which only
skirts the marshes at some distance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leiba,&rdquo; calls Sura from within, &ldquo;the coach is
coming, one can hear the bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Podeni valley is a ravine enclosed on all sides by wooded hills.
In a hollow towards the south lie several deep pools caused by the
springs which rise in the hills; above them lie some stretches of
ground covered with bushes and rushes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>Leiba&rsquo;s hotel
stands in the centre of the valley, between the pools and the more
elevated ground to the north; it is an old stone building, strong as a
small fortress: although the ground is marshy, the walls and cellars
are very dry.</p>
<p>At Sura&rsquo;s voice Leiba raises himself painfully from his chair,
stretching his tired limbs; he takes a long look towards the east, not
a sign of the diligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not coming; you imagined it,&rdquo; he replied to his
wife, and sat down again.</p>
<p>Very tired the man crossed his arms on the table, and laid his head
upon them, for it was burning. The warmth of the spring sun began to
strike the surface of the marshes and a pleasant lassitude enveloped
his nerves, and his thoughts began to run riot as a sick man&rsquo;s
will, gradually taking on strange forms and colours.</p>
<p>Gheorghe&mdash;Easter Eve&mdash;burglars&mdash;Jassy&mdash;the inn
in the centre of the town&mdash;a gay restaurant doing
well&mdash;restored health.</p>
<p>And he dozed.</p>
<p>Sura and the child went without a great deal up here.</p>
<p>Leiba went to the door of the inn and looked out on to the road.</p>
<p>On the main road there was a good deal of traffic, an unceasing
noise of wheels accompanied by the rhythmic sound of horses&rsquo;
hooves trotting upon the smooth asphalt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>But suddenly the traffic stopped, and from Copou a group of people
could be seen approaching, gesticulating and shouting excitedly.</p>
<p>The crowd appeared to be escorting somebody: soldiers, a guard and
various members of the public. Curious onlookers appeared at every door
of the inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Leiba, &ldquo;they have laid hands on a
thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The procession drew nearer. Sura detached herself from the others,
and joined Leiba on the steps of the inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Sura?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A madman escaped from Golia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us close the inn so that he cannot get at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is bound now, but just now he escaped. He fought with all
the soldiers. A rough Gentile in the crowd pushed a Jew against the
madman and he bit him on the cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leiba could see well from the steps; from the stair below Sura
watched with the child in her arms.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a violent lunatic held on either side by two men:
his wrists were tightly bound over each other by a thick cord. He was a
man of gigantic stature with a head like a bull, thick black hair, and
hard, grizzled beard and whiskers. Through his shirt, which had been
torn in the struggle, his broad chest was visible, covered like his
head, with a mass of hair. His feet were bare; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>his
mouth was full of blood, and he continually spat out hair which he had
bitten from the Jew&rsquo;s beard.</p>
<p>Every one stood still. Why? The guards unbound the lunatic&rsquo;s
hands. The crowd drew to one side, leaving a large space around him.
The madman looked about him, and his fierce glance rested upon
Zibal&rsquo;s doorway; he gnashed his teeth, made a dash for the three
steps, and in a flash, seizing the child&rsquo;s head in his right hand
and Sura&rsquo;s in his left, he knocked them together with such force
that they cracked like so many fresh eggs. A sound was heard, a
scrunching impossible to describe, as the two skulls cracked
together.</p>
<p>Leiba, with bursting heart, like a man who falls from an immense
height, tried to cry out: &ldquo;The whole world abandons me to the
tender mercies of a madman!&rdquo; But his voice refused to obey
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Jew!&rdquo; cried some one, beating loudly upon the
table with a stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad joke,&rdquo; said Sura from the doorway of
the inn, &ldquo;thus to frighten the man out of his sleep, you stupid
peasant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has scared you, Jew?&rdquo; asked the wag, laughing.
&ldquo;You sleep in the afternoon, eh? Get up, customers are coming,
the mail coach is arriving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, according to his silly habit which greatly irritated the Jew,
he tried to take his arm and tickle him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; cried the innkeeper, drawing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>back and pushing him away with all his might.
&ldquo;Can you not see that I am ill? Leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach arrived at last, nearly three hours late. There were two
passengers who seated themselves together with the driver, whom they
had invited to share their table.</p>
<p>The conversation of the travellers threw a light upon recent events.
At the highest posting station, a robbery with murder had been
committed during the night in the inn of a Jew. The murdered innkeeper
should have provided change of horses. The thieves had taken them, and
while other horses were being found in the village the curious
travellers could examine the scene of the crime at their leisure. Five
victims! But the details! From just seeing the ruined house one could
believe it to have been some cruel vendetta or the work of some
religious fanatic. In stories of sectarian fanaticism one heard
occasionally of such extravagant crimes.</p>
<p>Leiba shook with a violent access of fever and listened aghast.</p>
<p>What followed must have undoubtedly filled the driver with respect.
The young passengers were two students, one of philosophy, the other of
medicine; they were returning to amuse themselves in their native town.
They embarked upon a violent academic discussion upon crime and its
causes, and, to give him his due, the medical student was better
informed than the philosopher. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"
href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>Atavism; alcoholism and its pathological consequences; defective
birth; deformity; Paludism; then nervous disorders! Such and such
conquest of modern science&mdash;but the case of reversion to type!
Darwin, H&auml;ckel, Lombroso. At the case of reversion to type, the
driver opened wide his eyes in which shone a profound admiration for
the conquests of modern science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is obvious,&rdquo; added the medical student. &ldquo;The
so-called criminal proper, taken as a type, has unusually long arms,
and very short feet, a flat and narrow forehead, and a much developed
occiput. To the experienced eye his face is characteristically coarse
and bestial; he is rudimentary man: he is, as I say, a beast which has
but lately got used to standing on its hind legs only, and to raising
its head towards the sky, towards the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, after so much excitement, and after a good
repast with wine so well vinted, and so well matured as Leiba&rsquo;s,
a phrase with a lyrical touch came well even from a medical
student.</p>
<p>Between his studies of Darwin and Lombroso, the enthusiastic youth
had found time to imbibe a little Schopenhauer&mdash;&ldquo;towards the
sky, towards the light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leiba was far from understanding these &ldquo;illuminating&rdquo;
ideas. Perhaps for the first time did such grand words and fine
subtleties of thought find expression in the damp atmosphere of Podeni.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>But that which he understood better than anything,
much better even than the speaker, was the striking illustration of the
theory: the case of reversion to type he knew in flesh and blood, it
was the portrait of Gheorghe. This portrait, which had just been drawn
in broad outline only, he could fill in perfectly in his own mind, down
to the most minute details.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The coach had gone. Leiba followed it with his eyes until, turning
to the left, it was lost to sight round the hill. The sun was setting
behind the ridge to the west, and the twilight began to weave soft
shapes in the Podeni valley.</p>
<p>The gloomy innkeeper began to turn over in his mind all that he had
heard. In the dead of night, lost in the darkness, a man, two women and
two young children, torn without warning from the gentle arms of sleep
by the hands of beasts with human faces, and sacrificed one after the
other, the agonized cries of the children cut short by the dagger
ripping open their bodies, the neck slashed with a hatchet, the dull
rattle in the throat with each gush of blood through the wound; and the
last victim, half-distraught, in a corner, witness of the scene, and
awaiting his turn. A condition far worse than execution was that of the
Jew without protection in the hands of the Gentile&mdash;skulls too
fragile for such fierce hands as those of the madman just now.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>Leiba&rsquo;s lips, parched with fever, trembled as they
mechanically followed his thoughts. A violent shivering fit seized him;
he entered the porch of the inn with tottering steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt,&rdquo; thought Sura, &ldquo;Leiba is not
at all well, he is really ill; Leiba has got &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; into
his head. Is not that easy to understand after all he has been doing
these last days, and especially after what he has done
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had had the inn closed before the lights were lit, to remain so
until the Sabbath was ended. Three times had some customers knocked at
the door, calling to him, in familiar voices, to undo it. He had
trembled at each knock and had stood still, whispering softly and with
terrified eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not move&mdash;I want no Gentiles here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he had passed under the portico, and had listened at the top of
the stone steps by the door which was secured with a bar of wood. He
shook so that he could scarcely stand, but he would not rest. The most
distressing thing of all was that, he had answered Sura&rsquo;s
persistent questions sharply, and had sent her to bed, ordering her to
put out the light at once. She had protested meanwhile, but the man had
repeated the order curtly enough, and she had had unwillingly to
submit, resigning herself to postponing to a later date any explanation
of his conduct.</p>
<p>Sura had put out the lamp, had gone to bed, and now slept by the
side of Strul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman was right. Leiba was really ill.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Night had fallen. For a long time Leiba had been sitting, listening
by the doorway which gave on to the passage.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Indistinct sounds came from the distance&mdash;horses trotting, the
noise of heavy blows, mysterious and agitated conversations. The effort
of listening intently in the solitude of the night sharpens the sense
of hearing: when the eye is disarmed and powerless, the ear seems to
struggle to assert its power.</p>
<p>But it was not imagination. From the road leading hither from the
main road came the sound of approaching horses. Leiba rose, and tried
to get nearer to the big door in the passage. The door was firmly shut
by a heavy bar of wood across it, the ends of which ran into holes in
the wall. At his first step the sand scrunching under his slippers made
an indiscreet noise. He drew his feet from his slippers, and waited in
the corner. Then, without a sound that could be heard by an unexpectant
ear, he went to the door in the corridor, just as the riders passed in
front of it at walking pace. They were speaking very low to each other,
but not so low but that Leiba could quite well catch these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to bed early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing he has gone away?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;His turn will come; but I should have
liked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was intelligible; the men were already some way away.</p>
<p>To whom did these words refer? Who had gone to bed or gone away?
Whose turn would come another time? Who would have liked something? And
what was it he wanted? What did they want on that by-road&mdash;a road
only used by anyone wishing to find the inn?</p>
<p>An overwhelming sense of fatigue seemed to overcome Leiba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be Gheorghe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leiba felt as if his strength was giving way, and he sat down by the
door. Eager thoughts chased each other through his head, he could not
think clearly or come to any decision.</p>
<p>Terrified, he re-entered the inn, struck a match, and lighted a
small petroleum lamp.</p>
<p>It was an apology for a light; the wick was turned so low as to
conceal the flame in the brass receiver; only by means of the opening
round the receiver could some of the vertical shafts of light penetrate
into a gloom that was like the darkness of death&mdash;all the same it
was sufficient to enable him to see well into the familiar corners of
the inn. Ah! How much less is the difference between the sun and the
tiniest spark of light than between the latter and the gloom of
blindness.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall ticked audibly. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>monotonous sound irritated Leiba. He put his hand
over the swinging pendulum, and stayed its movement.</p>
<p>His throat was parched. He was thirsty. He washed a small glass in a
three-legged tub by the side of the bar and tried to pour some good
brandy out of a decanter; but the mouth of the decanter began to clink
loudly on the edge of the glass. This noise was still more irritating.
A second attempt, in spite of his effort to conquer his weakness, met
with no greater success.</p>
<p>Then, giving up the idea of the glass, he let it fall gently into
the water, and drank several times out of the decanter. After that he
pushed the decanter back into its place; as it touched the shelf it
made an alarming clatter. For a moment he waited, appalled by such a
catastrophe. Then he took the lamp, and placed it in the niche of the
window which lighted the passage: the door, the pavement, and the wall
which ran at right angles to the passage, were illuminated by almost
imperceptible streaks of light.</p>
<p>He seated himself near the doorway and listened intently.</p>
<p>From the hill came the sound of bells ringing in the Resurrection
morning. It meant that midnight was past, day was approaching. Ah! If
only the rest of this long night might pass as had the first half!</p>
<p>The sound of sand trodden underfoot! But he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>was
sitting in the corner, and had not stirred; a second noise, followed by
many such. There could be no doubt some one was outside, here, quite
near. Leiba rose, pressing his hand to his heart, and trying to swallow
a suspicious lump in his throat.</p>
<p>There were several people outside&mdash;and Gheorghe! Yes, he was
there; yes, the bells on the hill had rung the Resurrection.</p>
<p>They spoke softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he is asleep. I saw when the lights went
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, we will take the whole nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will undo the door, I understand how it works. We must cut
an opening&mdash;the beam runs along here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to feel the touch of the men outside as they measured the
distance on the wood. A big gimlet could be heard boring its way
through the dry bark of the old oak. Leiba felt the need of support; he
steadied himself against the door with his left hand while he covered
his eyes with the right.</p>
<p>Then, through some inexplicable play of the senses, he heard, from
within, quite loud and clear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leiba! Here comes the coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was surely Sura&rsquo;s voice. A warm ray of hope! A moment of
joy! It was just another dream! But Leiba drew his left hand quickly
back; the point of the tool, piercing the wood at that spot, had
pricked the palm of his hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Was there any chance of escape? Absurd! In his burning brain the
image of the gimlet took inconceivable dimensions. The instrument,
turning continually, grew indefinitely, and the opening became larger
and larger, large enough at last to enable the monster to step through
the round aperture without having to bend. All that surged through such
a brain transcends the thoughts of man; life rose to such a pitch of
exaltation that everything seen, heard, felt, appeared to be enormous,
the sense of proportion became chaotic.</p>
<p>The work outside was continued with method and perseverance. Four
times in succession Leiba had seen the sharp steel tooth pierce through
to his side and draw back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, give me the saw,&rdquo; said Gheorghe.</p>
<p>The narrow end of a saw appeared through the first hole, and started
to work with quick, regular movements. The plan was easy to understand;
four holes in four corners of one panel; the saw made cuts between
them; the gimlet was driven well home in the centre of the panel; when
the piece became totally separated from the main body of the wood it
was pulled out; through the opening thus made a strong hand inserted
itself, seized the bar, pushed it to one side and&mdash;Gentiles are in
Leiba&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In a few moments, this same gimlet would cause the destruction of
Leiba and his domestic hearth. The two executioners would hold the
victim <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>prostrate on the ground, and Gheorghe, with heel
upon his body, would slowly bore the gimlet into the bone of the living
breast as he had done into the dead wood, deeper and deeper, till it
reached the heart, silencing its wild beatings and pinning it to the
spot.</p>
<p>Leiba broke into a cold sweat; the man was overcome by his own
imagination, and sank softly to his knees as though life were ebbing
from him under the weight of this last horror, overwhelmed by the
thought that he must abandon now all hope of saving himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Pinned to the spot,&rdquo; he said, despairingly.
&ldquo;Yes! Pinned to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stayed a moment, staring at the light by the window. For some
moments he stood aghast, as though in some other world, then he
repeated with quivering eyelids:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Pinned to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a strange change took place in him, a complete revulsion of
feeling; he ceased to tremble, his despair disappeared, and his face,
so discomposed by the prolonged crisis, assumed an air of strange
serenity. He straightened himself with the decision of a strong and
healthy man who makes for an easy goal.</p>
<p>The line between the two upper punctures of the panel was finished.
Leiba went up, curious to see the working of the tool. His confidence
became more pronounced. He nodded his head as though to say: &ldquo;I
still have time.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>The saw cut the last fibre near the hole towards which it was
working, and began to saw between the lower holes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are still three,&rdquo; thought Leiba, and with the
caution of the most experienced burglar he softly entered the inn. He
searched under the bar, picked up something, and went out again as he
entered, hiding the object he had in his hand as though he feared
somehow the walls might betray him, and went back on tiptoe to the
door.</p>
<p>Something terrible had happened; the work outside had
ceased&mdash;there was nothing to be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Has he gone? What has happened?&rdquo;
flashed through the mind of the man inside. He bit his lower lip at
such a thought, full of bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; It was an imaginary deception; the work began
again, and he followed it with the keenest interest, his heart beating
fast. His decision was taken, he was tormented by an incredible desire
to see the thing finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quicker!&rdquo; he thought, with impatience.
&ldquo;Quicker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the sound of bells ringing on the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, old fellow, the daylight will catch us!&rdquo; said
a voice outside, as though impelled by the will of the man within.</p>
<p>The work was pushed on rapidly. Only a few more movements and all
the punctures in the panel would be united. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last!</p>
<p>Gently the drill carried out the four-sided piece of wood. A large
and supple hand was thrust in; but before it reached the bars it sought
two screams were heard, while, with great force, Leiba enclosed it with
the free end of the noose, which was round a block fixed to the cellar
door.</p>
<p>The trap was ingeniously contrived: a long rope fastened round a
block of wood; lengthwise, at the place where the sawn panel had
disappeared, was a spring-ring which Leiba held open with his left
hand, while at the same time his right hand held the other end taut. At
the psychological moment he sprang the ring, and rapidly seizing the
free end of the rope with both hands he pulled the whole arm inside by
a supreme effort.</p>
<p>In a second the operation was complete. It was accompanied by two
cries, one of despair, the other of triumph: the hand is &ldquo;pinned
to the spot.&rdquo; Footsteps were heard retreating rapidly:
Gheorghe&rsquo;s companions were abandoning to Leiba the prey so
cleverly caught.</p>
<p>The Jew hurried into the inn, took the lamp and with a decided
movement turned up the wick as high as it would go: the light concealed
by the metal receiver rose gay and victorious, restoring definite
outlines to the nebulous forms around.</p>
<p>Zibal went into the passage with the lamp. The burglar groaned
terribly; it was obvious from the stiffening of his arm that he had
given up the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>useless struggle. The hand was swollen, the
fingers were curved as though they would seize something. The Jew
placed the lamp near it&mdash;a shudder, the fever is returning. He
moved the light quite close, until, trembling, he touched the
burglar&rsquo;s hand with the burning chimney; a violent convulsion of
the finger was followed by a dull groan. Leiba was startled at the
sight of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Leiba trembled&mdash;his eyes betrayed a strange exaltation. He
burst into a shout of laughter which shook the empty corridor and
resounded in the inn.</p>
<p>Day was breaking.</p>
<p>Sura woke up suddenly&mdash;in her sleep she seemed to hear a
terrible moaning. Leiba was not in the room. All that had happened
previously returned to her mind. Something terrible had taken place.
She jumped out of bed and lighted the candle. Leiba&rsquo;s bed had not
been disturbed. He had not been to bed at all.</p>
<p>Where was he? The woman glanced out of the window; on the hill in
front shone a little group of small bright lights, they flared and
jumped, now they died away, now, once more, soared upwards. They told
of the Resurrection. Sura undid the window; then she could hear groans
from down by the door. Terrified, she hurried down the stairs. The
corridor was lighted up. As she emerged through the doorway, the woman
was astonished by a horrible sight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Upon a wooden chair, his elbows on his knees, his beard in his hand,
sat Leiba. Like a scientist, who, by mixing various elements, hopes to
surprise one of nature&rsquo;s subtle secrets which has long escaped
and worried him, Leiba kept his eyes fixed upon some hanging object,
black and shapeless, under which, upon another chair of convenient
height, there burnt a big torch. He watched, without turning a hair,
the process of decomposition of the hand which most certainly would not
have spared him. He did not hear the groans of the unhappy being
outside: he was more interested, at present, in watching than in
listening.</p>
<p>He followed with eagerness each contortion, every strange convulsion
of the fingers till one by one they became powerless. They were like
the legs of a beetle which contract and stretch, waving in agitated
movement, vigorously, then slower and slower until they lie paralysed
by the play of some cruel child.</p>
<p>It was over. The roasted hand swelled slowly and remained
motionless. Sura gave a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leiba!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sign to her not to disturb him. A greasy smell of burnt
flesh pervaded the passage: a crackling and small explosions were
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leiba! What is it?&rdquo; repeated the woman.</p>
<p>It was broad day. Sura stretched forward and withdrew the bar. The
door opened outwards, dragging with it Gheorghe&rsquo;s body, suspended
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>the right arm. A crowd of villagers, all carrying
lighted torches, invaded the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon understood what had happened. Leiba, who up to now had
remained motionless, rose gravely to his feet. He made room for himself
to pass, quietly pushing the crowd to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen, Jew?&rdquo; asked some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leiba Zibal,&rdquo; said the innkeeper in a loud voice, and
with a lofty gesture, &ldquo;goes to Jassy to tell the Rabbi that Leiba
Zibal is a Jew no longer. Leiba Zibal is a Christian&mdash;for Leiba
Zibal has lighted a torch for Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man moved slowly up the hill, towards the sunrise, like the
prudent traveller who knows that the long journey is not achieved with
hasty steps. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=

<h2 class="main">At Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. L. Caragiale</span></p>
<p>It took a quarter of an hour to reach Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn. From
there to Upper Popeshti was about nine miles; at an easy pace, that
meant one hour and a half. A good hack&mdash;if they gave it oats at
the inn, and three-quarters&rsquo; of an hour rest&mdash;could do it
comfortably. That is to say, one quarter of an hour and three-quarters
of an hour made one hour, on to Popeshti was one hour and a half, that
made two and a half. It was past seven already; at ten o&rsquo;clock at
latest, I should be with Pocovnicu Iordache. I was rather late&mdash;I
ought to have started earlier&mdash;but, after all, he expected me.</p>
<p>I was turning this over in my mind when I saw in the distance, a
good gun-shot length away, a great deal of light coming from
Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn, for it still retained that name. It was now
really Madame Manjoala&rsquo;s inn&mdash;the husband died some five
years ago. What a capable woman! How she had worked, how she had
improved the place! They were on the point of selling the inn while her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>husband was alive. Since then she had paid off the
debts, and had repaired the house; moreover, she had built a flight of
stone steps, and every one said she had a good sum of money too. Some
surmised that she had found a hidden treasure, others that she had
dealings with the supernatural.</p>
<p>Once some robbers attempted an attack upon her. They tried to force
the door. One of them, the strongest, a man like a bull, wielded the
axe, but when he tried to strike he fell to the ground. They quickly
raised him up&mdash;he was dead. His brother tried to speak, but could
not&mdash;he was dumb. There were four of them. They hoisted the dead
man on to his brother&rsquo;s back, the other two took his feet that
they might carry him off to bury him somewhere away.</p>
<p>As they left the courtyard of the inn, Madame Manjoala began to
scream from the window, &ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; and in front of her
there suddenly appeared the sub-prefect with numerous men and four
mounted soldiers. The official shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the robbers escaped. The dumb man remained behind with his
dead brother on his back.</p>
<p>Now what happened at the trial? Every one knew the mute had been
able to speak. How could anyone doubt but that the dumb man was
shamming? They beat him till he was crazy to try and make his speech
come back, but in vain. Since then the lads had lost all desire to
attack the place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>While all this was passing through my mind I arrived at the inn. A
number of carts were waiting in the yard of the inn. Some were carrying
timber down the valley; others, maize up the hill.</p>
<p>It was a raw autumn evening. The drivers were warming themselves
round the fire. It was the light from the latter that had been visible
so far away. An ostler took my horse in charge to give him some oats in
the stable. I entered the tap-room where a good many men were drinking,
while two sleepy gipsies, one with a lute and one with a zither, were
playing monotonously in a corner. I was hungry and cold. The damp had
pierced through me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mistress?&rdquo; I asked the boy behind
the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the kitchen fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be warmer there,&rdquo; I said, and passed
through the vestibule, out of the tap-room into the kitchen.</p>
<p>It was very clean in the kitchen, and the smell was not like that in
the tap-room, of fur and boots and damp shoes; there was a smell of
new-made bread. Madame Manjoala was looking after the oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well met, Mistress Marghioala.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Mr. Fanica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a chance of getting anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to midnight even, for respectable people like
yourself.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mistress Marghioala quickly gave orders to one of the servants to
lay a table in the next room, and then, going up to the hearth,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, choose for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Marghioala was beautiful, well-built and fascinating, that
I knew; but never since I had known her&mdash;and I had known her for a
long time, for I had passed Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn many a time when my
dead father was alive, as the road to the town led by it&mdash;had she
appeared to me more attractive. I was young, smart and daring, much
more daring than smart. I came up on her left side as she was bending
over the hearth, and took her by the waist! with my hand I took hold of
her right arm, which was as hard as iron, and the devil tempted me to
give it a pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got nothing to do?&rdquo; said the woman, looking at
me askance.</p>
<p>But I, to cover my blunder, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What marvellous eyes you have, Mistress
Marghioala!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try and flatter me; you had better tell me what
to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me&mdash;give me&mdash;give me yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you have marvellous eyes, Mistress Marghioala!&rdquo;
sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing your father-in-law heard you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What father-in-law? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You think because you hide yourself under your cap that
nobody sees what you do. Aren&rsquo;t you going to Pocovnicu Iordache
to engage yourself to his eldest daughter? Come, don&rsquo;t look at me
like that, go into the next room to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had seen many clean and quiet rooms in the course of my life, but
a room like that one! What a bed! What curtains! What walls! What a
ceiling! All white as milk. And the lamp-shade, and all those crochet
things of every kind and shape! And the warmth, like being under a
hen&rsquo;s wing, and a smell of apples and quinces!</p>
<p>I was about to seat myself at the table, when, according to a habit
I had acquired in my childhood, I turned to bow towards the east. I
looked carefully round all along the walls&mdash;not an Icon to be
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; said Mistress
Marghioala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Icons. Where do you keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dash the Icons! They only breed worms and
wood-lice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a cleanly woman! I seated myself at the table, and crossed
myself as was my custom, when suddenly there was a yell. It appeared
that with the heel of my boot I had trodden upon an old Tom cat which
was under the table.</p>
<p>Mistress Marghioala jumped up quickly and undid the outside door.
The injured cat made a bound outside while the cold air rushed in and
extinguished the lamp. She groped about for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>matches.
I searched here, she searched there. We met face to face in the dark.
I, very bold, took her in my arms and began to kiss her. The lady now
resisted, now yielded; her cheeks were burning, her mouth was cold,
soft down fluttered about her ears. At last the servant arrived with a
tray with viands on it, and a light. We must have hunted some time for
the matches, for the chimney of the lamp was quite cold. I lit it
again.</p>
<p>What excellent food! Hot bread, roast duck with cabbage, boiled veal
sausages, and wine! And Turkish coffee! And laughter and conversation!
Good luck to Mistress Marghioala!</p>
<p>After coffee she said to the old maidservant: &ldquo;Tell them to
bring out a half-bottle of muscadine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That wonderful old wine! A sort of languor seized my every limb. I
sat on one side of the bed, draining the last amber drops from my
glass, and smoking a cigarette, while through the cloud of tobacco
smoke I watched Mistress Marghioala who sat on a chair opposite rolling
cigarettes for me. I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mistress Marghioala, you have marvellous eyes! Do you
know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it trouble you to make me another cup of coffee, not
quite so sweet as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How she laughed! When the maid brought the coffee-pot, she said:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, you sit talking here&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what
it is like outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A high wind has got up, and there is a storm
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet and looked at the time; it was nearly a quarter
to eleven. Instead of half an hour, I had been at the inn for two hours
and a half! That&rsquo;s what comes when one begins to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let some one get my horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? The ostlers have gone to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to the stables myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have bewitched you at Pocovnicu!&rdquo; said the lady
with a ripple of laughter, as she barred my passage through the
door.</p>
<p>I put her gently on one side and went out on to the veranda. It was
indeed a dreadful night. The drivers&rsquo; fires had died down, men
and animals were sleeping on the straw, lying one against the other on
the ground, while above them the wind howled wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great storm,&rdquo; said Mistress Marghioala,
shuddering as she seized me firmly by the hand. &ldquo;You are mad to
start in such weather. Stay the night here: start at daybreak
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forcibly withdrew my hand. I proceeded to the stables. With great
difficulty I roused an ostler and found my horse. I tightened the
girths, fastened the horse to the steps, and then went to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>the room
to bid my hostess good night. The woman, immersed in thought, was
sitting on the bed with my cap in her hand. She was turning and
twisting it about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have I to pay?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pay me when you come back,&rdquo; replied my hostess,
looking intently into the lining of my cap.</p>
<p>And then she rose to her feet and held it out to me. I took the cap,
and put it on my head, rather on one side.</p>
<p>I said, looking straight into the woman&rsquo;s eyes, which seemed
to shine most strangely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kiss your eyes, Mistress Marghioala!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A safe journey to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw myself into the saddle, the old servant opened the gate for
me, and out I rode. Resting my left hand on my horse&rsquo;s flank, I
turned my head round. Over the top of the fence could be seen the open
door of the room, and in the opening was outlined the white figure of
the woman with her hand above her arched eyebrows.</p>
<p>I rode at a slow pace whistling a gay song to myself until I turned
the corner of the fence to get to the road, when the picture was hidden
from my sight. I said to myself, &ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo; and crossed
myself. At that moment I plainly heard the banging of a door and the
mew of a cat. My hostess, unable to see me any longer, went hastily
back into the warmth and doubtless caught the cat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>in the
door. That damned cat! It was always getting under people&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>I had gone a good part of the way. The storm increased and shook me
in the saddle. Overhead, cloud after cloud hurried across the valley
and above the hill, as though in fear of chastisement from on high; now
massed together, now dispersed, they revealed at long intervals the
pale light of the waning moon.</p>
<p>The damp cold pierced through me. I felt it paralysing legs and
arms. As I rode with head bent to avoid the buffeting of the wind, I
began to feel pains in my neck; my forehead and temples were burning,
and there was a drumming in my ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have drunk too much,&rdquo; I thought to myself, as I
pushed my cap on to the nape of my neck, and raised my forehead towards
the sky.</p>
<p>But the whirling clouds made me dizzy. I felt a burning sensation
below my left rib. I drew in a deep breath of cold air, and a knife
seemed to drive right through my chest. I tucked my chin down again. My
cap seemed to squeeze my head like a vice. I took it off and placed it
on the point of my saddle. I felt ill. It was foolish of me to have
started. Everybody would be asleep at Pocovnicu Iordache. They would
not have expected me. They would not have imagined that I should be
silly enough to start in such weather. I urged on my horse which
staggered as though it, too, had been drinking.</p>
<p>The wind had sunk, the rain had ceased. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>was
misty; it began to grow dark and to drizzle. I put my cap on again.
Suddenly the blood began to beat against my temples. The horse was
quite done, exhausted by the violence of the wind. I dug my heels into
him, I gave him a cut with my whip; the animal took a few hasty paces,
then snorted, and stood still on the spot as though he had seen some
unexpected obstacle in front of him. I looked. I really saw, a few
paces in front of the horse, a tiny creature jumping and skipping. An
animal! What could it be? A wild beast? It was a very small one. I put
my hand to my revolver; then I clearly heard the bleat of a kid.</p>
<p>I urged on the horse as much as I could. It turned straight round
and started to go back. A few paces forward, and again it stood
snorting. The kid again! The horse stopped; it turned round. I gave it
some cuts with the whip and tightened the curb. It moved
forward&mdash;a few paces&mdash;the kid again!</p>
<p>The clouds had dispersed. One could see now as clearly as possible.
It was a little black kid. Now it trotted forward, now it turned back,
it flung out its hooves, and finally reared itself on to its hind legs
and ran about with its little beard in front, and its head ready to
butt, making wonderful bounds and playing every kind of wild antic.</p>
<p>I got off my horse, which would not advance for the world, and took
the reins up short. I bent down to the ground. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; I called the kid, with my hand as though I
wanted to give it some bran.</p>
<p>The kid approached, jumping continually. The horse snorted madly, it
tried to break away. I went down on my knees, but I held the horse
firmly. The kid came close up to my hand. It was a dear little black
buck which allowed itself to be petted and lifted up. I put it in the
bag on the right side among some clothes. At that moment the horse was
convulsed and shook in every limb as though in its death throes.</p>
<p>I remounted. The horse started off like a mad thing. For some time
it went like the wind over ditches, over mole-hills, over bushes,
without my being able to stop it, without my knowing where I was, or
being able to guess where it was taking me. During this wild chase,
when at any moment I might have broken my neck, with body frozen and
head on fire, I thought of the comfortable haven I had so stupidly
left. Why? Mistress Marghioala would have given me her room, otherwise
she would not have invited me.</p>
<p>The kid was moving in the bag, trying to make itself more
comfortable. I looked towards it; with its intelligent little head
stuck out of the bag it was peering wisely at me. The thought of
another pair of eyes flashed through my mind. What a fool I&rsquo;d
been.</p>
<p>The horse stumbled; I stopped him forcibly; he tried to move on
again, but sank to his knees. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>Suddenly, through an opening in the
clouds, appeared the waning moon, shining on the side of a slope. The
sight of it struck me all of a heap. It was in front of me! There were
then two moons in the sky! I was going uphill; the moon ought to be
behind me! I turned my head quickly to see the real moon. I had missed
my way&mdash;I was going downhill! Where was I? I looked ahead&mdash;a
maize-field with uncut stalks; behind me lay open field. I crossed
myself, and pressing my horse with my weary legs, I tried to help him
rise. Just then I felt a violent blow on my right foot. A cry! I had
kicked the kid! I put my hand quickly into the bag; the bag was empty.
I had lost the kid on the road! The horse rose shaking its head as
though it were giddy. It reared on to its hind legs, hurled itself on
one side, and threw me to the other; finally he tore away like a thing
possessed and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>By the time I got up, much shaken, I could hear a rustle among the
maize, and close by came the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice saying
clearly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Hi! May Heaven remove you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; I called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An honest man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gheorghe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which Gheorghe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natrut&mdash;Gheorghe Natrut, who watches the
maize-fields.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the figure of a man became visible among the maize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask, brother Gheorghe, where we are at this moment? I
have missed my way in the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you want to go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Upper Popeshti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! To Pocovnicu Iordache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you have not missed your road. You&rsquo;ll have
some trouble to get to Popeshti&mdash;you are only at Haculeshti
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Haculeshti?&rdquo; I said joyfully. &ldquo;Then I am close
to Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there; we are at the back of the stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and show me the way so that I don&rsquo;t just go and
break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been wandering about for four hours. A few steps brought us to
the inn. Mistress Marghioala&rsquo;s room was lit up and shadows moved
across the curtain. Who knew what other, wiser traveller had enjoyed
that bed! I should have to rest content with some bench by the kitchen
fire. But what luck! As I knocked some one heard me. The old
maidservant hurried to open to me. As I entered I stumbled over
something soft on the threshold. The kid! Did you ever! It was my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>hostess&rsquo; kid! It, too, entered the room and
went and lay down comfortably under the bed.</p>
<p>What was I to say? Did the woman know I had returned, or had she got
up very early? The bed was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Marghioala!&rdquo; So much I was able to say.</p>
<p>Wishing to thank God that I had escaped with my life, I started to
raise my right hand to my head.</p>
<p>The lady quickly seized my hand and pulling it down, drew me with
all her strength into her arms.</p>
<p>I can still see that room. What a bed! What curtains! What walls!
What a ceiling! All white as milk. And the lamp-shade, and all those
crochet things of every kind and shape! And the warmth, like being
under a hen&rsquo;s wing, and a smell of apples and quinces!</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>I should have stayed a long time at Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn if my
father-in-law, Pocovnicu Iordache, God forgive him, had not fetched me
away by force. Three times I fled from him before the marriage, and
returned to the inn, until the old man, who at all cost wanted me for a
son-in-law, set men to catch me and take me gagged to a little
monastery in the mountains. Forty days of fasting, genuflexions and
prayers. I left it quite repentant. I got engaged and I married.</p>
<p>Only lately, one clear winter&rsquo;s night, while my father-in-law
and I were sitting talking together, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>is the custom of the
country, in front of a flagon of wine, we heard from a prefect, who
arrived from the town where he had been making some purchases, that
during the day there had been a big fire at Haculeshti.
Manjoala&rsquo;s Inn had been burnt to the ground, burying poor
Mistress Marghioala, who thus met her end under a gigantic funeral
pyre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so at the last the sorceress was thrown on the
bonfire!&rdquo; said my father-in-law, laughing.</p>
<p>And I began to tell the above story for at least the hundredth time.
Pocovnicu maintained, among other things, that the lady put a charm
into the lining of my cap, and that the kid and the cat were one and
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was the devil, listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have been,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but if that is
so, then the devil, it seems, leads to the good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first it seems to be good, to catch one, but later one
sees where it leads one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your business,&rdquo; replied the old man,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s another story!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">Alexandru Lapushneanu<br>
1564&ndash;1569</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By C. Negruzzi</span></p>
<p>Jacob Eraclid, surnamed the &ldquo;Despot,&rdquo; perished by the
hand of Shtefan Tomsha, who then proceeded to govern the land, but
Alexandru Lapushneanu, after two successive defeats at the hands of the
tyrant&rsquo;s forces, fled to Constantinople, succeeded in securing
aid from the Turkish army, and returned to drive out the rapacious
Tomsha, and seize for himself the throne which he never would have lost
had the boyars not betrayed him. He entered Moldavia accompanied by
seven thousand spahees and three thousand mixed troops. He also brought
with him imperial orders for Han Tatar Nogai to collect some troops
with which to come to his aid.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu rode with Vornic Bogdan by his side, both were mounted
upon Turkish stallions, and were armed from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you, Bogdan,&rdquo; he said after a short pause,
&ldquo;shall we succeed?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How can your Highness doubt it,&rdquo; replied the courtier,
&ldquo;the country groans under the harshness of Tomsha. The whole army
will surrender when you promise them higher pay. Those boyars who are
still left alive are only held back by fear of death, but when they see
that your Highness comes with force they will at once flock to you, and
desert the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God we shall not be obliged to do what Voda Mircea did
in Muntenia; but as I have told you, I know our boyars, for I have
lived among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This matter must be left to your Highness&rsquo;s
sagacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking they drew near to Tecuci where they halted by a
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said a messenger approaching, &ldquo;some boyars
have arrived, and crave an audience of your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come,&rdquo; replied Alexandru.</p>
<p>Four boyars soon entered the tent, where he was sitting surrounded
by his boyars and officers; two of them were elderly men but the other
two were young. They were Vornic Motzoc, Postelnic Veveritza, Spancioc,
the noble, and Stroici. They approached Voda Alexandru, and bowed to
the ground, but without kissing the hem of his garment as was the
custom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, boyars!&rdquo; said Alexandru, forcing himself to
smile. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good health to your Highness,&rdquo; replied the boyars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; pursued Alexandru, &ldquo;of the
affliction of the land, and I have come to deliver it; I know the
country awaits me with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not imagine that it is so, your Highness,&rdquo; said
Motzoc. &ldquo;The country is quiet; it may be your Highness has heard
things that are not really facts, it being the habit of our people to
make stallions out of mosquitoes. For this reason the community has
sent us to tell you that the people do not want you, no one loves you,
and your Highness has only to turn back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not want me, I want you,&rdquo; replied Lapushneanu,
and his eyes flashed like lightning. &ldquo;You may not love me, I will
love you, and will come among you with your consent or without it. I
turn back? Sooner may the Danube change its course! Ah! The country
does not want me? Do I understand that you do not want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One dare not behead ambassadors,&rdquo; said Spancioc.
&ldquo;We are bound to tell you the truth. The boyars have decided to
take their way to Hungary, to Poland, and to Muntenia, where they all
have relations and friends. They will come with foreign armies, and woe
betide the poor country when we have war between us, and maybe your
Highness will not do well because Shtefan
Tomsha&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomsha! Has he taught you to speak with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>such
temerity? I know not what prevents me from smashing the teeth in your
jaw with this club,&rdquo; he said, seizing the weapon from
Bogdan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Has that wretched Tomsha taught
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who is worthy to be named the Anointed of God cannot be
wretched,&rdquo; said Veveritza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am not I, too, the Anointed of God? Did you not swear fealty
to me when I was only Petre Stolnic? Did you not choose me? What was my
reign like! What blood have I shed? Whom have I turned from my door
without due reward and help? And yet you do not want me, do not love
me? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed; a laugh that distorted the muscles of his face, and his
eyes blinked incessantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your Highness&rsquo;s permission,&rdquo; said Stroici,
&ldquo;we see that our country will once more be under the heel of the
heretics. When these hordes of Turks have robbed and devastated the
land, over whom will your Highness reign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with what will you satisfy the greed of these heretics,
whom your Highness has brought with you?&rdquo; added Spancioc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your possessions, not with the money of the peasants
whom you fleece. You milk the country dry, but now the time has come
when I will milk you dry. Enough, boyars! Return and tell him who sent
you to be on his guard lest I catch him, if he would not have me make
flutes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>out of his bones, and cases for my drums out of
his skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boyars retired sadly; Motzoc remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stay?&rdquo; asked Lapushneanu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire! Sire!&rdquo; said Motzoc, falling on his knees.
&ldquo;Reward us not after our iniquities! Remember this is your native
land, remember the scriptural admonition to forgive your enemies! Have
pity on the poor land. Sire! dismiss these pagan armies; come with only
a few Moldavians with you, and we will guarantee that not a hair of
your Highness&rsquo;s head shall be touched; and if you need armies we
will arm our women and our children, we will raise the country, we will
call up our retainers and our neighbours. Trust yourself to
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust myself to you?&rdquo; said Lapushneanu, comprehending
his plan. &ldquo;Perchance you think I do not know the Moldavian
proverb: &lsquo;The wolf may change his skin, but never his
habits&rsquo;? Perchance I do not know you, you especially? Do I not
know that when my army was outnumbered, when you saw that I was
defeated, you abandoned me? Veveritza is an old enemy of mine, but he
has never concealed the fact; Spancioc is still young, his heart is
full of love for his country; it pleases me to see his pride which he
does not attempt to conceal. Stroici is a child, who does not
understand men yet, and does not know the meaning of flattery, or a
lie; to him it seems that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>all birds that fly are fit to eat.
But you, Motzoc, seasoned veteran of hard times, accustomed to fawn on
every ruler, you have sold the Despot; you have sold me too, and will
now sell Tomsha; tell me, should I not be an arch fool to put my trust
in you? Still, I pardon you for daring to think that you could cheat
me, and I promise you my sword shall not stain itself with your blood;
I will spare you, for you are useful to me and will help to bear my
blame. The others are all drones, and the hive must be freed from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motzoc kissed his hand, like the dog which, instead of biting, licks
the hand that beats him. He was grateful for the promise given him. He
knew that Voda Alexandru would have need of an intriguer like himself.
The deputies had been commanded by Tomsha, in the event of their being
unable to turn Lapushneanu from his path, to take the road to
Constantinople, where by means of petitions and bribes they were to try
and compass his overthrow. But seeing that he came with the good will
of the Porte itself, and, moreover, fearing to return without any
success to Tomsha, he begged leave to remain in his company. This was
Motzoc&rsquo;s plan that he might himself adhere to Lapushneanu. Leave
was granted him.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Tomsha, not finding himself in a position to offer resistance, fled
into Valahia, and Lapushneanu found no obstacle in his path. The people
round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>met him with joy and hope, reminding themselves of
his first reign, during which he had not had time to develop his odious
character.</p>
<p>But the boyars trembled. They had two great reasons to be anxious:
they knew that the people hated them, and the monarch did not love
them.</p>
<p>Immediately upon his arrival Lapushneanu gave orders that all the
Moldavian towns, except Hotin, should be piled high with wood and
burnt, wishing thus to destroy the refuge of the discontented, who many
times, under the protection of their walls, hatched plots and attempted
rebellion. In order to undermine the influence of the boyars, and to
root out the feudal communities, he despoiled them of their estates
under every kind of pretext; in this way he deprived them of their only
means of reducing and corrupting the populace.</p>
<p>But not deeming this plan sufficient he put persons to death from
time to time. For the smallest official mistake, upon the utterance of
the slightest complaint, the head of the culprit was spiked upon the
gates of the churchyard, with a placard setting forth his fault, real
or imaginary; the rotting head was only removed to make room for
another.</p>
<p>No one dared to speak against him, much less plot. A numerous guard
of mercenaries, Albanians, Serbs, Hungarians, driven out on account of
their misdeeds, found shelter with Alexandru, who bribed them with high
pay; the Moldavian army, under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>captains who were his own
creatures, he kept on the frontiers, he gave the soldiers leave to go
to their own homes, retaining only a small number.</p>
<p>One day he was walking alone in the saloon of the royal palace. He
had had a long talk with Motzoc, who was in great favour, and who had
departed after devising a scheme for some fresh tax. He seemed
restless, he talked to himself, and was evidently meditating another
death or some fresh persecution when a side door opened, and admitted
the Princess Rucsanda.</p>
<p>At the death of her parent, the good Petru Raresh, who&mdash;says
the chronicle&mdash;was buried amidst much lamentation and mourning in
the sacred Monastery of Probota, erected by himself, Rucsanda remained,
at a tender age, under the guardianship of her two elder brothers,
Iliash and Shtefan: Iliash, succeeding his father upon the throne,
after a short and stormy reign, retired to Constantinople where he
embraced Mohammedanism, and Shtefan took his place upon the throne.
This man was more cruel than his brother; he began by compelling all
strangers and Catholics to renounce their religion, and many rich
families settled in the country went into exile on this account, giving
as a pretext the poverty of the land and the decline in trade. The
boyars, many of whom were related by marriage to the Poles and
Hungarians, took offence, and entering into communication with the
exiled boyars decided that Shtefan should perish. Perhaps they would
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>delayed to put this plan into execution if his
excesses had not hastened it on. &ldquo;No woman was safe from his lust
if she were fair,&rdquo; says the chronicler in his na&iuml;ve fashion.
One day when he was at Tzutzora, instead of waiting for the arrival of
the exiled boyars, the boyars who were with him cut the ropes of the
tent under which he was seated, in order to prevent his escape, and
rushing upon him murdered him.</p>
<p>After this Rucsanda alone remained of the family of Petru Raresh,
and the murderous boyars decided to give her as wife to one of their
number called Jolde, whom they had chosen to be their ruler. But
Lapushneanu, chosen by the exiled boyars, met Jolde, whom he defeated,
and seizing him he cut off his nose, and turned him into a monk; in
order to win the hearts of the people, who still kept a lively
recollection of Raresh, he married, and took to himself Raresh&rsquo;s
daughter. Thus the gentle Rucsanda found herself the partner of the
conqueror.</p>
<p>When she entered the hall she was clothed with all the magnificence
due to the wife, daughter and sister of a king.</p>
<p>Above a long garment of cloth of gold, open in front, she wore a
tight coat of blue velvet trimmed with sable, and with long sleeves
falling back; she wore a girdle of gold which fastened with big clasps
of jasper surrounded by precious stones; round her neck hung a necklace
of many rows of pearls. A cap of sable, placed rather on one side, was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>ornamented with a white aigrette studded with
jewels and held in place by a big emerald flower. Her hair, according
to the fashion of the day, was parted and hung in braids over her back
and shoulders. Her face was of that beauty which once made famous the
Roumanian women, but which is rarely found to-day, for it has
degenerated through the mingling of foreign blood. She was also sad and
languishing, like a flower exposed unshaded to the burning heat of the
sun. She had seen her father die, had witnessed the abdication and
withdrawal of one brother and the murder of another. She had first of
all been destined by the community to be the wife of Jolde&mdash;whom
she did not know&mdash;then she was forced by that same community, who
disposed without question of her heart, to give her hand to Alexandru
Voda whom she honoured and obeyed as her husband, and whom she would
have been ready to love had she found in him the least trace of human
feeling. Drawing near, she bent and kissed his hand. Lapushneanu took
her by the waist, and lifting her as though she were a feather placed
her upon his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tidings, my fair lady?&rdquo; he said, kissing her on
the brow. &ldquo;For what reason have you to-day, which is not a feast
day, deserted your spinning-wheel? What has roused you so
early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tears the widowed women shed at my door, and which cry to
the Lord Christ and the Holy Virgin for vengeance for all the blood you
shed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lapushneanu&rsquo;s face grew dark, and he unclasped his hands;
Rucsanda fell at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good my Lord! my brave husband!&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;It is enough! You have spilt so much blood, made so many widows,
so many orphans. Consider that your Highness is all powerful, and that
a few poor boyars cannot harm you. What does your Highness lack? You
are not at war with anyone; the land is quiet and submissive.
I&mdash;God knows how much I love you! Your Highness&rsquo;s children
are fair and young. Reflect that after life comes death, and that your
Highness is mortal and must give <span class="corr" id="xd19e1357"
title="Source: acount">account</span> of his deeds, for blood is not
redeemed by building monasteries; especially is it tempting and
insulting God to deem that you can propitiate him by erecting churches
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoughtless woman!&rdquo; cried Lapushneanu, jumping to his
feet, and from force of habit he put his hand to the dagger at his
belt; but instantly controlling himself, he bent forward, and raising
Rucsanda from the floor he said: &ldquo;My wife, do not let such
foolish words escape your lips, for God only knows what might happen.
Be thankful to the great saint and martyr, Dimitric Isvoritor, of
blessed memory, to whose honour we dedicate the church which we have
built at Pangaratzi, that he has hindered us from committing a great
sin, and caused us to remember that you are the mother of our
children.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though I know you will murder me I cannot keep silence.
Yesterday when I wished to come in, a woman with five children threw
herself in front of my carriage and stopped me to show me a head
fastened to the courtyard gate. &lsquo;You will have to answer for it,
Madam,&rsquo; she said to me, &lsquo;if you allow your husband to
behead our fathers, husbands and brothers. See, Madam, that is my
husband, the father of these children who are left orphans! Look
well.&rsquo; And she showed me the gory head, and the head looked
terribly at me! Ah, Sire, since then I see that head incessantly, and I
am afraid! I cannot rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you?&rdquo; asked Lapushneanu, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will that you spill no more blood, that you cease to kill,
that I may see no more decapitated heads which make my heart
break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you that after the day after to-morrow you will see
no more,&rdquo; replied Alexandru Voda, &ldquo;and to-morrow I will
give you a remedy for fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you will see. Now, sweet lady, go and see your
children, and attend to your house like a good mistress, and see to the
preparations for a feast, for to-morrow I give a great dinner to the
boyars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess Rucsanda departed after once more kissing his hand. Her
husband accompanied her to the door. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, have you arranged everything?&rdquo; he asked, moving
quickly towards his esquire who entered at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>At eventide came the news that on the next day, being Sunday, all
the boyars were to assemble at the Metropolitan Church, where the
Prince would be present to attend the Liturgy, and afterwards were to
feast at the court.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of Alexandru Voda divine service began; the boyars
were all assembled. Contrary to his usual custom, Lapushneanu was
dressed with regal splendour that day. He wore the crown of the
Paleologs; over his long Polish tunic of crimson velvet, he wore a
Turkish royal cloak. He carried no weapon except a small dagger, inlaid
with gold; but between the fastenings of the tunic could be seen a
shirt of mail.</p>
<p>After listening to divine service he descended from his stall,
prostrated himself before the Icon, and approaching the shrine of St.
John the New, bent forward with great humility and kissed the sacred
relics. It is said that at that moment his face was very yellow, and
that the saintly shrine shook.</p>
<p>Then once more ascending his stall, he turned to the boyars and
said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Most noble boyars! From the time I assumed kingship until
this day, I have shown myself harsh towards many: I have been cruel,
severe, shedding much blood. Only God knows how hard this has been for
me, and how I regret it, but you, boyars, know that I have only been
constrained thereto by the desire to end the various quarrels and
disputes which aimed at the disturbance of the country and my
destruction. To-day the state of affairs is different. The boyars have
come to their senses; they have realized that the flock cannot exist
without a shepherd as the Saviour said: &lsquo;They were distressed and
scattered as sheep not having a shepherd.&rsquo; Most noble boyars! Let
us henceforth live in peace, loving one another like brothers, for this
is one of the ten commandments: &lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself,&rsquo; and let us pardon one another, seeing that we are
mortal, beseeching our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;&mdash;here he made the
sign of the cross&mdash;&ldquo;to forgive us our daily trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having finished this disjointed speech, he passed to the centre of
the church, and after prostrating himself once more turned towards the
people in front, and to the right and to the left of him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, good people, and you also, most noble
boyars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God forgive you, your Highness!&rdquo; they all replied,
except two young boyars who were standing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>lost in thought, hidden
by a tomb near the door, where no one paid heed to them.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu left the church, bidding the boyars come and dine
together with him; he mounted his horse and returned to the palace.</p>
<p>The people dispersed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; said one of the boyars, who,
we have seen, did not extend his pardon to Alexandru Voda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise you not to dine with him to-day,&rdquo; replied the
other.</p>
<p>And they mixed with the crowd. They were Spancioc and Stroici.</p>
<p>At the court great preparations had been made for this feast. The
news had spread that the Prince had made his peace with the boyars, and
the boyars rejoiced at the change, in the hopes they would once more
occupy positions whence they could amass fresh wealth at the expense of
the sweating peasants. As to the people, they were indifferent; they
neither expected good nor feared evil from this reconciliation. The
people were reconciled to the rule of Alexandru Voda. They only
grumbled about his Minister, Motzoc, who took advantage of his credit
with the Prince to cheat the mass of the people. Thus, although the
complaints of the community were continual about the thefts of Motzoc,
Lapushneanu either would not answer them or would not listen to
them.</p>
<p>As the hour of the feast drew near, the boyars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>arrived
on horseback, each accompanied by two or three retainers. They noticed
that the courtyard was full of armed mercenaries and that four guns
were trained upon the doors, but they concluded they were placed there
to fire the usual ceremonial salute. Perhaps one or two suspected a
trap, but once inside it was impossible to return, for the gates were
guarded and the sentries had orders to let no one pass out.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu joined the boyars, forty-seven in number, and placed
himself at the head of the table, placing the Chancellor, Trotushan,
upon his right, and Home Secretary, Motzoc, upon his left. The pipes
began to play, and the viands were placed upon the table.</p>
<p>In Moldavia at that period there was nothing remarkable in the
fashion of the food. The banquet only comprised a few varieties of
dishes. After the Polish soup came Greek dishes of boiled vegetables
floating in butter, then Turkish rice and finally a roast. The
table-cloth was of home-spun linen. The dishes containing the food, the
plates and the goblets, were of silver. Along the wall stood a row of
earthenware jars full of wine from Odobeshti and from Cotnari, and at
the back of each boyar waited some servant who poured out the wine.</p>
<p>In the courtyard by the side of two roast oxen and four roast sheep,
three casks of wine had been broached; the retainers ate and drank, the
boyars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>ate and drank. Soon brains began to get inflamed:
the wine began to do its work. The boyars saluted, and congratulated
the Prince with loud applause, to which the mercenaries responded with
shouts and the guns with salvos.</p>
<p>They were on the point of rising from the table when Veveritza
raised his glass, and bowing, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May your Highness live for many years! May you rule the land
in peace and may a merciful God strengthen the desire you have shown to
no longer molest the boyars or afflict the
people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish for the dagger of an esquire struck him right on
the forehead and felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you would insult your Prince!&rdquo; cried the esquire.
&ldquo;Upon them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a second, all the servants behind the boyars drew their daggers
and struck them; other soldiers under the captain of mercenaries
entered and slashed at them with their swords. In the meanwhile
Lapushneanu took Motzoc by the hand and drew him to the open window
whence to watch the butchery which began. He laughed; but Motzoc,
forcing himself to laugh, felt the hair rising upon his head, and his
teeth chattering. And, in truth, it was horrible to watch that bloody
scene. The fancy must picture a hall 33 ft. long and 30 ft. wide, a
hundred and more desperate men, determined to kill, executioners and
victims, some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>fighting with the fury of despair, others with
drunken rage. The boyars had had no suspicions, thus treacherously
attacked from behind, and unarmed, they fell unable to defend
themselves. The older men died making the sign of the cross; but many
of the younger ones defended themselves with desperation; chairs,
plates, the implements upon the table became weapons in their hands;
some of the wounded gripped with fury the throats of the assassins, and
in spite of the injuries they received they squeezed them till they
suffocated. If one among them found a sword he sold his life dearly.
Many a mercenary perished, but finally not a boyar remained alive.
Forty-seven corpses lay upon the floor! In the struggle and turmoil the
table was overturned; the jars were broken and the wine mixed with
blood made a pool upon the boards of the hall.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the murder upstairs began the massacre in the
courtyard.</p>
<p>The boyars&rsquo; servants, finding themselves set upon without
warning by the soldiers, tried to flee. Only a few escaped with their
lives; they succeeded in scaling the walls and gave the alarm in the
boyars&rsquo; homes: they called out others of the boyars&rsquo;
retainers and men, and roused the populace. The whole city flocked to
the gates of the courtyard, which they began to destroy with axes. The
soldiers, stupid with drink, made little resistance. The crowd grew
stronger and stronger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lapushneanu, when he recognized the strength of the crowd, sent an
esquire to inquire what they wished. The esquire went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Vornic Motzoc,&rdquo; he said, turning towards that
person, &ldquo;tell me, have I not done well to rid myself of this
rabble, to free the land from this sore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness has acted with great wisdom,&rdquo; replied the
obsequious courtier; &ldquo;I have long had it in my mind to advise
your Highness to do this, but I see your Highness&rsquo;s sagacity has
anticipated me, and you have done well to destroy;
because&mdash;why&mdash;it was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the esquire tarries,&rdquo; said Lapushneanu, cutting
short Motzoc, who was becoming involved in his speech. &ldquo;I think
we will give orders to fire a round into the mob. Ha! what think
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, let us turn the guns on them; there is
not much loss in a few hundred churls dying when so many boyars have
perished. Yes, let us destroy them root and branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected just such an answer,&rdquo; said Lapushneanu with
irritation, &ldquo;but we will see first what it is they
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the esquire stepped through the door into the
courtyard, and making a sign, cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good people! His Highness sends to inquire what it is you
want and ask, and wherefore you are come with so much noise?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>The crowd stood open-mouthed. They had not expected such a question.
They had come without knowing why, or what they wanted. They collected
quietly into little groups and asked one another what it was they did
want. At last they began to shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remit the taxes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Cease to harass us!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do not kill us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not rob us!&rdquo; &ldquo;We
remain poor!&rdquo; &ldquo;We have no money!&rdquo; &ldquo;Motzoc has
taken our all!&rdquo; &ldquo;Motzoc! Motzoc!&rdquo; &ldquo;He fleeces
us and ruins us!&rdquo; &ldquo;He advises the Voda!&rdquo; &ldquo;Let
him die!&rdquo; &ldquo;To death with Motzoc!&rdquo; &ldquo;We want the
head of Motzoc!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words found an echo in every heart, and were like an
electric spark. All the voices rang together as one voice, and this
voice cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask for Motzoc&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they ask for?&rdquo; asked Lapushneanu, as the
esquire entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head of Vornic Motzoc,&rdquo; replied the esquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? What?&rdquo; cried Motzoc, jumping like a man who has
trodden on a serpent. &ldquo;You did not hear aright, fool! You try to
jest, but this is no time for jesting. What words are these! What would
they do with my head? I tell you, you are deaf, you did not hear
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But very well,&rdquo; said Alexandru Voda, &ldquo;just
listen. Their cries are audible here.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>In fact, as the soldiers no longer resisted them, the people had
begun to clamber up the walls whence they shouted at the top of their
voices:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us Motzoc!&rdquo; &ldquo;We want Motzoc&rsquo;s
head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, miserable sinner that I am!&rdquo; cried the wretched
man, &ldquo;most Holy Mother of God, do not let me be destroyed. What
have I done to these men? Holy Virgin save me from this danger, and I
swear to build a church to pray for the rest of my days, I will
enshrine with silver the miracle-working Icon from the Neamtzu
Monastery. But gracious Prince, do not listen to these common people,
to these churls. Command that the guns decimate them. Let them all die!
I am a great boyar, they are only churls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Churls, but many of them,&rdquo; replied Lapushneanu coldly:
&ldquo;would it not be a sin to murder many men for the sake of one?
Only reflect. Go and sacrifice yourself for the good of the realm, as
you yourself said when you told me that the country neither wanted me
nor loved me. Rejoice that the people repay you for the service you
rendered me, betraying to me the army of Anton Sechele, then destroying
me, and taking Tomsha&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, unfortunate man that I am!&rdquo; cried Motzoc, tearing
his beard, for he realized from the tyrant&rsquo;s words that there was
no escape for him. &ldquo;At least let me go and put my house in order!
Have pity upon my wife and children! Give me <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>time to
confess!&rdquo; And he cried and screamed and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried Lapushneanu. &ldquo;Do not wail like a
woman. Be a brave Roumanian. What can you confess? What can you say to
the priest? That you are a thief and robber? All Moldavia knows that.
Come! Take him and give him to the people and tell them that this is
the way Alexandru Voda serves those who rob the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The esquire and the captain of mercenaries immediately laid hands
upon him.</p>
<p>The wretched boyar yelled as loudly as possible, trying to protect
himself, but how could his old hands shield him from the four strong
arms that carried him? He tried to stand upon his feet, but they caught
in the dead bodies of the victims and slipped upon the blood which had
congealed upon the boards. As last his strength became exhausted, and
the tyrant&rsquo;s satellites carried him more dead than alive to the
door of the courtyard, and thrust him out among the crowd.</p>
<p>The miserable boyar fell into the arms of the many-headed Hydra,
which in a second tore him to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how Alexandru Voda rewards those who rob the land!&rdquo;
said the tyrant&rsquo;s emissaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live His Highness the Voda!&rdquo; replied the crowd.
And they dispersed, rejoicing over their victim.</p>
<p>While the unhappy Motzoc was being thus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>treated,
Lapushneanu ordered that the table should be replaced, and the utensils
collected; the heads of the murdered were then cut off, and the bodies
thrown out of the window. After which, he took the heads and quietly
and methodically set them in the middle of the table; he placed the
less important boyars below, and the more important above, according to
their family and rank, until he had made a pyramid of forty-seven
heads, the top of which he crowned with the head of an important
Logofat. Then after washing his hands, he went to a side door, withdrew
the bolt and wooden bar which secured it, and entered the
Princess&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>From the beginning of this tragedy, the Princess Rucsanda, ignorant
of what was taking place, had been anxious. She did not understand the
cause of the noise she heard, for, according to the custom of the time,
women could not leave their apartment, and the servants could not risk
going amongst soldiers of whose discipline they knew nothing. One among
them, bolder than the others, had gone out, had heard it said that an
attack had been made upon the Voda, and had carried these tidings to
her mistress.</p>
<p>The gentle Princess was terrified, fearing the fury of the mob, and
when Alexandru entered he found her praying before the Icon, with her
children by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;our Lady be praised that I see
you again! I have been greatly frightened.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore? Because I promised I would prepare you a remedy
for fear? Come with me, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those cries, those shouts we heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. The servants began to wrangle, but they are quiet
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he took Rucsanda by the hand, and led her to the
dining-hall. She gave a cry of horror at the terrible sight and
fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman is always a woman,&rdquo; said Lapushneanu, smiling,
&ldquo;instead of rejoicing, she is horrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted her in his arms, and took her back to her apartment. Then
he returned again to the hall where he found the captain of mercenaries
and the esquire awaiting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can throw these corpses over the wall to the dogs, but
set their heads upon the wall,&rdquo; he said to the mercenary.
&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said, addressing the esquire, &ldquo;are to
lay hands upon Spancioc and Stroici.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stroici and Spancioc were already close to the Dniester.</p>
<p>Their pursuers only caught up with them when they had crossed the
frontier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him who sent you,&rdquo; Spancioc shouted back,
&ldquo;that he will not see us till he is about to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Four years passed since this scene, during which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>time
Alexandru Lapushneanu, faithful to the promise made to the Princess
Rucsanda, did not execute a single boyar. But, because he was unable to
stifle his overmastering desire to witness human suffering, he invented
various forms of torture.</p>
<p>He had eyes put out, noses cut off, he mutilated and maimed any
person he suspected; even his suspicions were imaginary, for no one
ventured to make the slightest complaint. All the same he was not at
ease, for he could not lay hands on Spancioc and Stroici, who remained
at Kamenitza, waiting, abiding their time. Although he had two
highly-placed sons-in-law with great influence at the Polish court, he
was anxious lest these two boyars should solicit the aid of the Poles,
who were only seeking a pretext to invade Moldavia; but these two
Roumanians were too good patriots not to reflect that war and the
arrival of foreign soldiers would be the ruin of their native land.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu wrote to them many times in succession that if they
would only return he would pledge himself, by the most sacred oath, to
do them no harm; but they knew the value of his oath. In order to
observe them more closely, he moved to the town of Hotin which he
fortified with care, but he became ill from spleen here. The disease
made rapid strides, and the tyrant soon saw himself at the portal of
the tomb.</p>
<p>In the delirium of his fever he seemed to see all the victims of his
cruelty, terrifying and admonitory, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>threatening him and calling to
the most just God for justice. In vain he tossed upon his bed of
sickness, he could not find relief.</p>
<p>Summoning Teofan, the Metropolitan, the Bishops and boyars, he
informed them that he felt the end of his life to be approaching; he
humbled himself, and implored pardon for all the wrong he had done.
Finally, he begged for consideration for his son, Bogdan, to whom he
left the throne of the realm if they would assist him. Being of tender
years, and surrounded by powerful enemies, he would be unable to
protect either himself or his country unless the boyars preserved unity
among themselves and affection and loyalty to the Ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo; he proceeded to say, &ldquo;if I
recover from this sickness, I am determined to become a monk in the
Monastery of Slatina, where I may repent for the rest of the days that
it pleases God to leave me. Therefore, I beseech you, Fathers, when you
see me at the point of death to shave me like a
monk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not able to say much more. He was seized with convulsions,
and a terrible coma like death itself stiffened his body, so that the
Metropolitan and the Bishops, believing him to be expiring, canonized
him, bestowing upon him the name of Paisie after that of Peter, which
name he had borne previous to becoming Prince. After this they paid
homage to the Princess Rucsanda as regent during <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the
minority of her son, and proclaimed Bogdan king.</p>
<p>Immediately after they sent envoys to all the boyars within the
country and to the exiles, and to the captains of the army.</p>
<p>The twilight was approaching when Stroici and Spancioc arrived.</p>
<p>Dismounting at an inn, they approached the castle with haste. The
town was silent and dreary like some gigantic tomb. Only the murmuring
waters of the Dniester were audible as they continually washed the
slopes of the grey bare banks, and the monotonous cry of the sentries
who examined each other by the evening light along the length of their
lances. Pursuing their way into the palace, they experienced no small
surprise at meeting no one; at last a lacquey showed them the sick
man&rsquo;s room. As they were about to enter they heard a loud noise,
and paused to listen.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu was rousing from his lethargy. Upon opening his eyes he
saw two monks standing, the one at his head, and the other at his feet,
motionless, like two statues of bronze; he glanced at himself, and
found himself clothed in the habit of a monk; round his head was a
cowl. He tried to raise his hand, but was prevented by the strings of a
rosary. It seemed to him as though he dreamed, and he closed his eyes
again; but opening them once more after a little while he saw the same
things, the rosary, the cowl, the monks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling now, Brother Paisie?&rdquo; one of the
monks asked him, seeing that he was not sleeping.</p>
<p>This name brought back to his mind all that had taken place. His
blood began to boil and half raising himself he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these? Ah, you are making fun of me! Avaunt, foul
creatures! Go, or I will murder you all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought a weapon with his hand, but finding nothing but the cowl
he flung it with his hand at the head of one of the monks.</p>
<p>At the sound of his shouting, the Princess, with her son, the
Metropolitan, the boyars and servants, all entered the room.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other two boyars arrived and stood by the door
listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you wanted to turn me into a monk,&rdquo; cried
Lapushneanu in a raucous and terrible voice. &ldquo;You thought to get
rid of me? But you can dismiss that idea! God or the devil will make me
well again, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy man, do not blaspheme,&rdquo; said the Metropolitan,
cutting him short. &ldquo;Do not forget you are in the hour of death!
Reflect, sinful man, that you are a monk, you are no longer Ruler!
Reflect that such ravings and yells are frightening this innocent
woman, and this child in whom rests the hope of Moldavia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infernal hypocrite!&rdquo; added the sick man, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>endeavouring to rise from his bed. &ldquo;Hold
your tongue; it was I who made you Metropolitan, and I unfrock you. You
tried to make me a priest but I will put that right. There are many I
will make into priests. But as for that bitch, I will cut her into four
pieces with her pup so that they may never again listen to the advice
of hypocrites or to my enemies. He lies who says I am a monk. I am no
monk&mdash;I am Ruler. I am Alexandru Voda! Help! Help! Where are my
soldiers? Fetch them! Fetch them all! I will command them. Kill all
these people. Let none escape. Ah! I am choking! Water! Water!
Water!&rdquo; And he fell back exhausted, gasping with excitement and
fury.</p>
<p>The Princess and the Metropolitan retired. At the door they came
face to face with Stroici and Spancioc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Spancioc, seizing Rucsanda&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;that man must die at all costs. See this powder, pour it into
his drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; she cried with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; pursued Spancioc. &ldquo;Unless this man dies
at once, the lives of your Highness and your son are in danger. The
father has lived long enough and done enough. Let the father die that
the son may live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant came out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the Princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sick man has roused and asks for water <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>and his
son. He bade me not to return without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they wish to kill him,&rdquo; groaned the wretched
mother, pressing her son passionately to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not time for hesitation, Madam,&rdquo; added
Spancioc. &ldquo;Think of the wife of Voda Shtefanitza and choose
between father and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you, Father?&rdquo; said the poor woman, turning
towards the Metropolitan, with her eyes full of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is cruel and fierce, my daughter; may the Lord God
give you counsel. As for me, I go to prepare for our departure with our
new Ruler; for our late Prince, may God pardon him, and also forgive
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the holy Teofan departed.</p>
<p>Rucsanda took a silver cup full of water, which was handed to her by
the servant, and then, amid the entreaties and arguments of the boyars,
poured the poison into it. The boyars pushed her into the sick
man&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; asked Spancioc of Stroici, who
pushed open the door again and looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asks for his son&mdash;he says he wishes him to come to
him&mdash;he asks for a drink&mdash;the Princess trembles&mdash;she
gives him the cup&mdash;he will not take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spancioc starts and draws his dagger from his belt. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes, he takes it, he drinks. May it do your Highness
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rucsanda emerged shaking and livid, and supporting herself against
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must render account before God,&rdquo; she said, sighing,
&ldquo;for you have caused me to commit this sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Metropolitan arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he said to the Princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who will tend to this wretched man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; replied the boyars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, what have you made me do!&rdquo; said the
Princess to the Metropolitan, and she went sobbing with him.</p>
<p>The two boyars went into the sick man. The poison had not yet begun
to do its work. Lapushneanu lay stretched out, his face uppermost, calm
but very weak. When the two boyars entered, he looked at them for some
time, but not recognizing them he asked who they were, and what they
had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Stroici,&rdquo; replied one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Spancioc,&rdquo; added the other, &ldquo;and our
wish is to see you before you die as we promised you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my enemies!&rdquo; sighed Alexandru.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Spancioc,&rdquo; continued that person, &ldquo;Spancioc
whom you would fain have beheaded when you murdered the forty-seven
boyars, and who escaped from your clutches! Spancioc, whose
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>property you have destroyed leaving his wife and
children to beg for alms at the doors of Christian houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I feel as though a fire burnt me!&rdquo; cried the sick
man, grasping his stomach with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day we free ourselves, for you must die. The poison
works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have poisoned me, infamous creatures! Oh, what a
fire! Where is the Princess? Where is my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone away and left you to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone away and left me! Have left me to you! Oh,
kill me and let me escape from suffering. Oh, stab me, you are still
young, have pity, free me from the agony that rends me, stab me!&rdquo;
he said, and turned towards Stroici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not desecrate my noble dagger with the blood of such a
worthless tyrant as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pains increased. The poisoned man writhed in convulsions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my very soul burns me! Oh, give
me water&mdash;give me something to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Spancioc, taking the silver cup from the
table, &ldquo;the dregs of the poison are left. Drink and quench your
thirst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, I will not,&rdquo; said the sick man, setting his
teeth.</p>
<p>Then Stroici seized him and held him tight while Spancioc, drawing a
knife from its sheath, unclenched his teeth with its point and poured
down his throat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>the poison which had remained at the bottom of the
cup.</p>
<p>Lapushneanu, roaring like a bull which sees the hand and axe which
is about to strike him, tried to turn his face towards the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you do not want to see us?&rdquo; said the boyars.
&ldquo;No, but it is meet that you should see in us your punishment;
learn to die, you who have only known how to kill.&rdquo; And seizing
him both together, they held him inflexibly, staring at him with
devilish delight and reviling him.</p>
<p>The unhappy Prince writhed in spasms of agony, he foamed at the
mouth, he gnashed his teeth, and his bloodshot eyes protruded out of
his head; an icy sweat, sad forerunner of death, broke out in drops
upon his brow. After a torture of half an hour, he finally yielded up
the ghost in the hands of his judges.</p>
<p>Such was the end of Alexandru Lapushneanu, who leaves a bloody page
in the history of Moldavia.</p>
<p>A portrait of himself and his family may be seen to this day in the
Monastery at Slatina, which he built, and where he is buried.

<h2 class="main">Zidra</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By M. Beza</span></p>
<p>We were talking in the inn at Grabova and passing round the wine
without troubling ourselves as to the lateness of the hour. In time we
began to sing&mdash;as it is the custom to sing in these parts. One
raises his voice, while the others subdue theirs, till all take up the
chorus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Your head lies in my pouch,</p>
<p class="line xd19e1711">Zidra, mighty Zidra!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Only our friend, Mitu Dola, was silent; he was much
moved and kept turning first to one side and then to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that song!&rdquo; he gasped when we stopped. Then
suddenly to me: &ldquo;Do you know who Zidra was? And do you know who
killed Zidra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his mug, drank from it several times, and then, with a
brain clouded by distant memories and the strong wine, he began to tell
me the story:</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be some thirty years ago. Zidra was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>then a
haiduk in the Smolcu mountains. What a man! There was a heavy price
upon his head. His very name, passed from mouth to mouth, brought a
wave of fear. And we children would gather together in the evening
under the eaves of the fountains, by the church doors, and talk of
Zidra. This much we knew: at one time he had lived amongst us and then
had unexpectedly disappeared from the village; on account of some
murder everybody said. After a long time he appeared again, robbing a
long way this side of Smolcu: &lsquo;Zidra is at Seven-Hills; Zidra is
in the Vigla Forest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whispering thus secretly, we would glance over our shoulders.
We would shiver as though we could feel a cold breath from the dark
thicket whence Zidra might appear. I pictured him just like my father,
probably because my father, too, was a striking figure. In a coat with
long flowing sleeves, his cap on one side, and his belt loaded with
pistols, my father&mdash;like all tax-gatherers at that
period&mdash;was on the road a great deal of his time, so that my
mother and I remained alone for weeks on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a house just on the outskirts of the village
surrounded by a beech wood, the shadows of which hung darkly above our
heads. How it would begin to moan at night! The rustling of the leaves,
the prolonged roar of the rocking trees was like some great waterfall.
From our soft bed, clasped in my mother&rsquo;s arms, I listened to the
fierce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>din. From time to time it ceased; then, through
the silence, came the sound of whistling, of shots, of the trampling of
horses and of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sighed with terror. &lsquo;Mother, supposing robbers should
attack us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hush! It is unlucky to speak of such
things.&rsquo; &lsquo;You know, mother, Zidra is in Vigla
Forest.&rsquo; When I first mentioned this name my mother trembled and
started back, but quickly coming forward she said hastily and with
unusual anxiety: &lsquo;Who told you this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Cousin Gushu,
mother. Gushu&rsquo;s father, mother, saw a host of vultures over Vigla
Forest circling round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother repeated in a puzzled way: &lsquo;Vultures circling
round&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Then, after thinking a moment, she said to
herself: &lsquo;That is it; that is where he halted and had his
food&mdash;the vultures are attracted by the smell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, arriving a few days later, said the same thing,
while he added that some shepherds had also seen Zidra. My mother was
delicate, her features bore the melancholy expression of some hidden
sorrow. She looked wan and remained staring into space. &lsquo;Eh?
What?&rsquo; said my father sternly. &lsquo;Why should I be afraid of
Zidra?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He closed the conversation. But into our house there crept an
unexplained disquietude&mdash;something intangible, blowing like an icy
breath that made my mother shudder. How could I understand then? Time
alone has given me the explanation of it all. And to-day when I think
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>of the spot where this dark mystery unfolded
itself old scenes and things emerge from oblivion and stand vividly
before me. I see the yard of our house with the door opening into the
wood, the staircase leading into the bedroom; here is the hearth and
along the walls are the great wooden cupboards. Sitting upon the
corner-seat by the fire my mother spun at her wheel&mdash;often she
would start to spin but seemed as though she could not. She would
constantly stop, her thoughts were elsewhere. And if I asked her
anything, she would nod her head without listening to me. Only when,
amid the loud rustle of the trees, I would mention Zidra she would turn
quickly, her eyes wide open, and say with a shiver:
&lsquo;Zidra?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when night fell she would try the doors one after the
other. She would walk up and down, a pine-torch in her hand, passing
through visions of horror, and with her went the smoking flame which
rose and fell as it struggled with the shadows, moving upon the
ceilings and floors and on the walls of the room where the sofa was,
where it lit up for a second the hanging weapons: an old musket, two
scimitars, some pistols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes there was a pleasant silence over everything. The
wood slept, the country, too, was asleep. Then, in the light of the
little icon-lamp, could be heard the gentle hum of the spinning-wheel,
murmuring like a golden beetle in a fairy-tale, lulling me till I
slept. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;During one of these nights&mdash;the wheel stopped and I
heard my mother saying: &lsquo;Tuesday at Custur, Wednesday at Lehova,
Thursday&mdash;Thursday&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; She knew where my father
usually stayed and was calculating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becoming confused she began again from the beginning:
&lsquo;Tuesday at Custur, Wednesday at Lehova, Thursday&mdash;Thursday
on the road.&rsquo; And she rose. She went to the lamp to pour in oil
that it might burn till the daylight. In the meantime a noise came from
the yard and was repeated more loudly. &lsquo;Mother, some one is
knocking!&rsquo; &lsquo;Who could be knocking?&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a moment of indecision she went downstairs.
Unintelligible words followed&mdash;a man&rsquo;s voice, the door was
shaken. My mother began to speak gently, inaudibly. Soon everything was
silent again. By my side I could hear my mother&rsquo;s breath, coming
short and with difficulty, but her tongue remained tied. When she
recovered herself she said suddenly: &lsquo;Can I? How can I open? I am
married. I cannot.&rsquo; &lsquo;To whom, mother&mdash;to whom must you
open?&rsquo; She took me tremblingly in her arms, squeezed me to her,
and pressed her burning cheek against mine. &lsquo;You are too little.
You do not understand, my treasure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, after a while, talking more to herself, while the tears
flowed slowly down her cheeks: &lsquo;At the fountain in Plaiu&mdash;it
is long ago. We pledged our word&mdash;at dusk&mdash;God saw us; and in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>the end he made off one day, and I waited for
him&mdash;years and years I waited. Now what does he want? I am
married. What does he expect? Why did he come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus much I remember. I fell asleep close to my mother. The
next day she might just have got up after a long illness so white was
she in the face, with fear shining in her eyes. When my father saw her
he raised the thick bushy eyebrows which gave such a harsh appearance
to his hairy face. &lsquo;There is something wrong, something has
happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could she deny it? They went into the room where the sofa
stood, and soon after my father broke out with: &lsquo;From henceforth
either I or he!&rsquo; And he stormed about, taking long heavy strides
while the weapons clattered on the wall. He swore, and added with a
wild burst of laughter: &lsquo;Ha, ha! And the head and two hundred
ducats!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on he no longer took the road; he remained on guard.
Spies began to move about. Fierce-looking men knocked at the door. My
father went out, exchanged some rapid words with them, among which
could be continually heard the name of Zidra, and they disappeared. But
what were those cries, those sharp whistles through the night? Often,
too, across the hillocks came the sound of stones&mdash;stones striking
one against the other, and my father replied in the same way. And the
knocking sounds rose sonorous, ringing through the darkness as though
some strange birds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>were rattling their beaks. I heard it in my
sleep and shuddered. &lsquo;Have no fear,&rsquo; whispered my mother,
&lsquo;it is nothing, my dear one. Your father is talking&mdash;with
some sentries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few weeks passed thus, until one midnight there appeared in
the further room four men in black cloaks, carrying guns; they seemed
to have sprung out of the ground. They shook hands and without a
moment&rsquo;s pause began moving about in the ruddy, uncertain light
of the pine-torch. In the silence outside&mdash;a silence caused by the
fog which deadened all sound&mdash;their words could be overheard. As
my father slung his scimitar over his shoulder, one of them said in a
loud clear voice: &lsquo;At Stic&oacute;tur, in the monastery.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Since when?&rsquo; &lsquo;Since dinner-time to-day&mdash;he is
eating and drinking.&rsquo; &lsquo;The man is caught,&rsquo; said
another. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t escape this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went out quickly; they were lost in the black darkness
which began to vibrate with the rising of the wind. The bushes rattled
and bent beneath the rain&mdash;storms of rain beat and splashed
against the window-panes, a sea of sound, storm after storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Here, as far as I can remember, Mitu Dola brought the story to a
close. I asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear the song? My father took the head and
put it in his pouch. As he said, &lsquo;and the head and two hundred
ducats.&rsquo;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"

<p>Mitu Tega returned to the house much annoyed. As he entered his wife
asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, has he not turned up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not to-day either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what happens when you rely on an unknown man, a
stranger. Suppose he never comes. God forbid that he should go off with
the whole herd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tega did not reply. He sat motionless in the silent veranda, which
gradually grew dark with shadows of the evening mist, and pondered. Of
course such things did happen; he might have taken the goats and gone
off, in which case let him find him who can! Where could one look for
him? Whither could one follow him?</p>
<p>And as he meditated thus he seemed to see the shepherd before his
eyes; he called to mind the first day he had seen him; a terrible man,
like a wild man from the woods, with a great moustache <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>lost in
a hard, black beard, which left only his eyes and cheek-bones visible.
He came into him, and without looking him in the face, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard&mdash;some people told me that you want a man to
tend the bucks. Take me, I am a shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tega gave him one look, he was just the kind of man he wanted. He
asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come&mdash;well, from Blatza. Toli&mdash;Toli the
shepherd&mdash;I have been with many other goat owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tega looked at him again, considered a little, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ll take you; may you prove honest, for, look,
many a man has cheated me, and many a man has stolen from me up to
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he engaged him. Toli stayed with Tega, and no one could have
conducted himself better.</p>
<p>A month later they went together to the Salonica district, where
they bought goats, over eight hundred head. When it was time to return,
Tega&mdash;for fear of attack by brigands&mdash;went ahead secretly,
leaving Toli to follow on alone with the herd. The days slipped
by&mdash;one week, two&mdash;Toli did not put in an appearance. What
could have happened? Many ideas passed through Tega&rsquo;s brain.
Especially after what his wife had said. At night he could not sleep.
He dozed for a while, and then woke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>again, with his mind on the
shepherd, tormenting himself, until the crowing of the cocks heralded
the dawn. Then he got up; and, as he was short and plump, he took a
staff in his hand, and proceeded to the nearest hill whence could be
seen the country opening out as flat as the palm of a hand.</p>
<p>At that hour the first blush of dawn glowed in the east. And slowly,
slowly rose the sun. Round, purple, fiery, it lit first the crests of
the mountains, then flashed its rays into the heart of the valleys; the
window-panes in the village suddenly caught the fiery light; the birds
began to fly; on the ground, among the glistening dew, flowers raised
their heads out of the fresh grass, a wealth of daisies and buttercups
like little goblets of gold. But Mitu Tega had no time for such things.
His eyes were searching the landscape. Something was moving
yonder&mdash;a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The herd, it is the herd!&rdquo; murmured Tega.</p>
<p>He could hear the light, soft tinkle of the bells, sounding
melodiously in the spring morning. And see, see&mdash;the herd drew
near, the bell-carrier in front, two dogs with them, and last of all
the shepherd with his cloak round his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; cried Tega with all his heart. &ldquo;But,
Toli, you have tarried a long while. I was beginning to
wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you, I did not come direct, I had to go
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bucks played around, a fine, picked lot with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>silky
hair, they roamed about, and Tega felt as though he, too, could skip
about, could take the shepherd in his arms, and embrace him for sheer
joy.</p>
<p>As in other years, Tega kept the herd on the neighbouring slopes, on
the Aitosh hills. It was Toli&rsquo;s business to get the bread, salt,
and all that was needed, and once every two or three days, leaving the
herd in the care of a comrade, he would take his way to his
employer&rsquo;s house. Usually Tega&rsquo;s wife would be spinning at
her wheel when he went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Toli,&rdquo; the woman said pleasantly. &ldquo;Tega
is not at home at present, but sit down, Toli, sit down, and wait till
he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd took off his cloak, and did not say another word.</p>
<p>The veranda where they were sitting was upstairs; through the open
windows the eye could follow the distant view; the hills lay slumbering
in the afternoon light, along their foot lay a road&mdash;processions
of laden mules, whole caravans ascending slowly and laboriously,
winding along in bluish lines till lost to sight over the brow of the
hill. The woman followed them with her eyes, and without moving, from
her wheel, pointing with her hand, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are sheepfolds yonder, too, aren&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never asked you, Toli, how are the goats <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>doing?
Do you think my man chose well this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all. He said no more. His deep-set eyes were sad, and black
as the night. A minute later footsteps sounded in the garden, and then
the voice of a neighbour:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, dear, where have you hidden
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Lena, here,&rdquo; replied the woman upstairs.</p>
<p>Lena mounted the stairs. Behind her came Doda Sili and Mia; they had
all brought their work, for they would not go away till late in the
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard?&rdquo; asked Lena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more murders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suspicion had fallen upon Gardana. He had become a kind of vampire
about whom many tales were told. Especially old men, if they could
engage you in conversation, would try and impress you with the
story.</p>
<p>In a village lived a maiden, modest and very beautiful. She was
small, of the same age as Gardana, who was a boy then. They were fond
of each other, they played together, they kissed each other&mdash;they
kissed as children kiss. But after a while the girl&rsquo;s form took
on the soft curves of coming womanhood; then it came to pass that they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>never kissed each other, they knew not why, and
when they were alone they did not venture to look into each
other&rsquo;s eyes; she would blush like a ripe apple, and
Gardana&rsquo;s lips would tremble. Then there appeared upon the scene,
from somewhere, a certain Dina, son of a rich somebody; the girl
pleased him, and he sent her an offer of marriage. Her father did not
think twice, her father gave her to him.</p>
<p>And Gardana&mdash;would you believe it&mdash;after he realized that
it was hard fact, gnashed his teeth, beat his breast, and disappeared.
Two days later he was on the mountains, and a gang with him.</p>
<p>Eh! love knows no bounds, love builds, but love also destroys many
homes.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s father was seized and murdered; not long after Dina
was murdered too. Then Gardana spread terror for many years in
succession.</p>
<p>For some time now, whatever he might have been doing, wherever he
might be in hiding, nothing had been heard of him. But as soon as
something happened, his name once again passed round the village:
&ldquo;Gardana, it is Gardana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was not he, perhaps he had left the mountains, perhaps
even he was dead; but the people who knew something&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many did you say there were?&rdquo; asked Mia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two; both merchants. They came from abroad.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And who can have murdered them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one but&mdash;Gardana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it? But is Gardana still alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, do you think he really is dead? No, no, they alone give
this kind of tidings of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have to be on their guard, the bailiffs are after them,
they might capture them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spinning-wheel spun on. The spool wound the thread, the treadle
hummed, filling the room with a soothing noise.</p>
<p>Doda Sili said wonderingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what kind of man he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very big man, but large enough to terrify one, with a
black beard&mdash;oh, so black!&mdash;and, when you least expect it,
there he is on your road, just as though he had sprung out of the
ground. Didn&rsquo;t our Toli once meet him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spinning-wheel stopped suddenly. A swarm of gnats came in
through the windows, and buzzed round in the warmth of the sun; and
Lena said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on his way from the sheepfold; he came upon Gardana on
the Padea-Murgu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it might have been somebody else.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was he, he himself, with that beard, those
garments&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the conversation continued. Toli, the shepherd, took no part
in the talk. He sat over on the floor, silent, impassive&mdash;like a
moss-grown stone. Only occasionally he raised his bushy eyebrows, and a
troubled, misty look shone in his eyes. Tega&rsquo;s wife wondered to
herself, she could not understand him; really, what was the matter with
him? He was brave, she knew he had not his equal for courage, when he
had charge of the herd not an animal was ever lost; all the same, what
a man he was, always frowning, and never a smile on his lips! There
must be something with him, naturally it must be&mdash;&mdash; And
breaking off her train of thought she suddenly spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toli, during all the months you have been with us I have
never asked you whether you are married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was unexpected. The shepherd seemed to be considering.
Then he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You have never married? Have you no wife, no
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home&mdash;ah!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;You are right, even I
once had a home, even I had hopes of a bride, but they came to
nought&mdash;what would you, it was not written in the book of
destiny&mdash;I was poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke haltingly, and his eyes wandered here <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>and
there. And after one motion of his hand, as though to say &ldquo;I have
much sorrow in my heart,&rdquo; he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl is dead&mdash;and I, too, shall die, everything
will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>One afternoon in March, as the shepherd did not appear, Mitu Tega
prepared to go alone to the fold. He brought out the horse, bought two
bags of bread, and a lamb freshly killed, went to the mill where he
procured some barley, and then on slowly, quietly&mdash;he on foot, the
horse in front&mdash;till he reached his destination just as the sun
was disappearing behind the Aitosh mountains.</p>
<p>The shepherds rubbed their eyes when they saw him, but he called
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought a lamb for roasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must eat it with us,&rdquo; said Toli, &ldquo;and stay
the night here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for they expect me at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you start back at this hour?&rdquo; put in Panu,
Toli&rsquo;s comrade. &ldquo;The night brings many perils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was getting quite dark. Stars twinkled. Whether he wished to or
not, Mitu Tega was obliged to remain. Then the shepherds set to work;
one put the lamb on to the spit, and lit the fire; the other fetched
boughs from the wood. He brought whole branches with which they
prepared a shelter for the night for Tega&mdash;within was a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>bed of green bracken. Then all three stretched
themselves by the fire. Gradually the flames sank a little, on the heap
of live coals the lamb began to brown, and spit with fat, and send out
an appetizing smell. The moon shone through the bushes; they seemed to
move beneath the hard, cold light which flooded the solitude. The
shadows of the mountains stretched away indefinitely. Above, some night
birds crossed unseen, flapping their wings. Mitu Tega turned his head.
For a moment his glance was arrested: by Toli&rsquo;s side, a gun and a
long scimitar lay shining on the ground. He was not nervous,
otherwise&mdash;&mdash;He glanced at Toli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a man!&rdquo; thought Tega. &ldquo;I have nothing to
fear while I am with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began to eat, quickly and hungrily, tearing the meat with their
fingers, not speaking a word. Toli picked up the shoulder-bone of the
lamb, and drew near the fire, to scrutinize it, for some omen for the
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Tega asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;only it seems to me&mdash;that there is blood
everywhere, that blood pursues. Look, and you, too, Panu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; murmured Panu, &ldquo;a little blood, one
can see a spot, two red patches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hours passed. The dogs started off towards the woods. From their
bark there might be dangerous men on the move. Toli listened a moment,
took his gun, and said quickly to Tega: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any weapon about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have&mdash;a pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it out, and go in there, and do not move. But you, Panu,
get more over there&mdash;not near the fire, move into the
shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely finished speaking before the brigands were upon
them. They came stealthily through the bushes, avoiding the moonlight,
but the shepherd saw them, and without waiting fired a chance shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; cried the
robbers.</p>
<p>A great noise arose&mdash;the flock scattered, the barking of the
dogs became gradually more and more excited; there was another report,
and yet another. Toli&rsquo;s gun gave a dull sound and was followed by
several cries:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will kill us all like this, all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with your arms, lay down your arms!&rdquo; cried
Toli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, man, we are putting them down; only don&rsquo;t
shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toli&rsquo;s voice thundered. His voice alone was enough to make one
tremble.</p>
<p>The brigands threw down their arms, and advanced. There were three
of them. One was quite a young man, about thirty-five years of age,
with a worn face, and very pale. Blood was flowing from one foot and
clotting on to his white gaiters as it flowed. Toli went up to him and
said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wounded you&mdash;have I wounded you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brigand did not reply. Toli crossed his arms and shaking his
head asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it me you meant to rob? Was it me you meant to attack? Do
you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes, they stared at each
other&mdash;deep into each other&rsquo;s eyes they gazed. Each one was
thinking: &ldquo;Where have I seen him before?&rdquo; for they had
surely known each other somewhere. Vague memories of their past life,
of bygone years began to stir, and gradually, recollection dawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardana,&rdquo; said the brigand, &ldquo;is it
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mitu Tega was startled. He shivered as though iced water were being
poured down his back. Who had uttered that name? Where was Gardana? He
was thunder-struck by what followed: Toli and the robbers shook hands,
embraced each other and conversed with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardana, Gardana, I thought you were dead&mdash;they told me
you had died, Gardana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother,&rdquo; said Toli. &ldquo;It might have been
better if I had died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after, a short pause:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are in pain, brother; I have hurt you&mdash;look, you
were within an ace of being killed, brother Manole, and I should have
had another man&rsquo;s soul, and another man&rsquo;s blood upon my
head. There, you were nearly killed. What brought you, what drew you
within range of my gun? Within <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>an ace, brother
Manole&mdash;another man&rsquo;s soul, another man&rsquo;s
blood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time for many years he seemed moved with self-pity. He
tore a strip from his shirt, bent over Manole, and dressed his wound.
The others watched, amazed. The waters were sleeping, the forests were
sleeping. From the trees, from the valleys, from the grass, came voices
murmuring in the silence of the night, soft, remote, a sort of breath,
more like a sigh from the sleeping earth. Manole spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Gardana? We were on the Baitan mountains,
you know&mdash;at Piatra-de-Furca&mdash;we were together when the
bailiffs hemmed us in on all sides&mdash;a host of them. We held our
own till nightfall. Eh! and then I saw what stuff Gardana was made of!
You gave us one call and went straight ahead&mdash;we after you, and so
we escaped, we cut our way through with our scimitars. Then, when the
trumpets gave the alarm, and the guns began to go off, I lost sight of
you, Gardana; we were all scattered, I remained alone in the valley
under Piatra-de-Furca. Do you remember? It must be five years,
more&mdash;six years ago. Where are all our comrades now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our comrades&mdash;they have gone away, I let them go.
Brother Manole, heavy curses lie on my head&mdash;enough to crush me,
brother. I was not a bad man. You know how many times I went to Dina. I
said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t drive me too far, bethink <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>yourself.&rsquo; And I went to the girl&rsquo;s
father. But you see Dina was rich, Dina had flocks of sheep. And her
father gave her to him without asking whether the girl loved him. And
after that, tell me, brother, could I sit patiently by, bite my nails
and say nothing? Could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toli Gardana ceased speaking. After a moment of reflection he added
softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the girl faded away&mdash;she died of grief and
disappointment. One day the earth will cover me too, our bodies may rot
anywhere, and no one will weep&mdash;not a tear, they will all rejoice.
I don&rsquo;t know, brother, but since that girl died it seems to me I
am not the man I was. I wanted to kill myself, I roamed about here, and
one day I went to Tega. I was strong&mdash;I gave out that I came from
Blatza, and that I was a shepherd; who was he that he should know
differently! But you, brother, how has the world treated
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harshly, Gardana. I was shut up in Tricol for three years.
Prison cut me off from life. For months I dug&mdash;with hands and
nails I dug&mdash;until one night, during a storm, I broke through the
wall and escaped with these two companions. And when I found myself
back among these mountains my thoughts turned to you. I had heard you
were dead, Gardana; but see what has happened, and how it has come to
pass, how fate brings these things about, brother Gardana ... it is not
a month since I escaped....&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107"
href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before they were aware of it the shadows of the night began to melt
away. The brigands ceased to speak as though they feared the signs of
the coming day. They remained silent, their heads upon the ground in
the face of the glory of the flaming dawn.</p>
<p>Toli Gardana asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should we know? No matter where. There are many
forests.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

<h2 class="main">The Dead Pool</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By M. Beza</span></p>
<p>We seemed to be between Mount Gramos and Mount Deniscu. I guessed it
to be so from the peaks, which showed like some fancies of the night,
keeping steadfast watch in the moonlight; the moon we could not see, we
could only feel her floating over us. The pale light shone only in the
ether above, and gradually diminished till it was lost to the eyes in a
mass of shadows; they fell like curtains, enveloping us, dense, black.
The silence extended indefinitely; it was as though the world here had
remained unchanged since its creation. Hardly a breath of wind reached
us. It always carried with it at this spot the same odour of dank
weeds, of plants with poisonous juices; everything told of the
neighbourhood of water&mdash;not fresh water, but water asleep for
centuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see the pool?&rdquo; questioned my companion, Ghicu
Sina; and then he added: &ldquo;It is hidden, certainly, but look with
attention.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>I looked, and after a time, getting accustomed to the darkness, I,
too, got the impression of something shining and smooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pool&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the pool? Some lights too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; I whispered with a shudder.</p>
<p>There on the surface of the water were flickering points of fire.
They could not come from above, they were not glow-worms, or sparks
such as one sees passing over graves.</p>
<p>Ghicu Sina spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are reflections, the lights are burning in the
pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the fear that seizes us in the presence of the supernatural, I
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What induced us to stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where else could we stop? There are no sheep-folds in these
parts, formerly there were such, but since the death of the Spirit who
guarded the mountains, none of them remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause he said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of dead pools?&rdquo; He stood immersed in
thought. &ldquo;This is a dead pool. I will tell you about it.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, when the trees were bursting into leaf,
this district was full of sheep. Flock after flock passed through,
handled by sturdy shepherds, well known in their own neighbourhood.
Then one spring-tide a stranger showed his face, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>beautiful as a god, wearing upon his shoulders a
cloak as white as snow. Every one wondered, &lsquo;Who may he be, and
whence does he come?&rsquo; Many tales passed round until the mystery
began to unravel itself. In the valley of the Tempe, so runs the story,
whither he had wandered with the sheep, he fell in love with the
beautiful Virghea. Mad with love, when the family made the winter-move,
he followed her to the mountains; he came with a comrade and wandered
about till he settled his sheep-fold here, in these parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! where had the fame of this Virghea of Gramuste not
reached! All the beauties of nature seemed to have bestowed some gift
upon her: the blue of heaven&mdash;the colour of her eyes; the shadow
of the woods&mdash;the mystery of their liquid depths; the setting
sun&mdash;the gold of her soft hair; the springs&mdash;the tone of her
silvery laugh. Attracted by such charms every youth fell at the feet of
Virghea. But she did not care; only when her eyes rested on the
shepherd did her youthful being fill with a burning desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now day after day from the high ground about the sheep-fold
could be heard the sound of a flute; heard in the stillness of the dusk
it roused strange longings in the girl&rsquo;s breast. Then she would
steal out of the house, and the shepherd himself would come down
towards Gramuste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this time, there broke loose such a storm as had never
been seen before. The peaks began <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>to rattle as though the
mountains were changing places, striking each other with noise like
thunder. Thus it continued for three days. Only on the fourth day, late
in the evening, could the shepherd leave the fold: he had taken only a
few steps when&mdash;what a sight met his eyes by the side of the pool!
A big fire, and round it a shadowy form. And suddenly the phantom spoke
with hand pointing to the spit which he held above the heap of burning
coals: &lsquo;The heart of the Spirit of Deniscu.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a flash the shepherd realized the meaning of the hurricane
of the last few days. The guardian Spirits of the mountains had striven
together, and one had been overthrown. The shadow continued to speak:
&lsquo;Turn this spit that I may rest a while. Taste not of the heart,
for if you touch it you will immediately die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shadow fell into a profound slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the side of the fire the shepherd looked fearfully on all
sides. Far off, in the pale blue sky, a star broke away; it fell with a
long tail of fire, and went out. &lsquo;Some one will die,&rsquo;
sighed the shepherd. The words of the Spirit flashed through his mind.
&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If I taste, perhaps the
contrary is true, who knows?&rsquo; So thinking, he put his finger on
the heart on the spit and carried it to his mouth. The sensation was
unspeakably pleasant. He laughed; then quickly ate the whole heart.
Immediately there rose within him a cruel <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>passion towards the
sleeping Spirit; upon the spot he killed it and took the heart. At once
there came to him the strength of a giant, the ground began to tremble
beneath his footsteps, while aerial voices, and voices from the water,
sounded round him. Creatures never seen before emerged from the pool;
linked together by their white hands they danced round in whirling
circles. Thus changed, he reached his comrade at the fold, and tried to
explain, but his thoughts were elsewhere, and his voice sounded as
though from another world. He finished with broken words: &lsquo;The
water calls me&mdash;tell no one what has happened to me&mdash;take my
flute: if danger threatens come to the pool and sing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the evenings that followed Virghea saw naught of the
shepherd, and she wondered at not seeing him, expecting him from day to
day. So days passed that seemed like weeks, and weeks seemed months,
and they went by without any news of him till the poor maiden took to
her bed from grief. Then the comrade of the hills remembered the
shepherd&rsquo;s words. He came at midnight to the side of the pool and
sang&mdash;a long time he sang. Towards dawn, when the strains of the
flute died away, there came from Gramuste the sound of two strokes of a
bell, then another two, and others in succession, mournful, prolonged.
The echoes answered back, as though other bells were ringing in other
places, resounding from hill to hill until <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>they
reached the bottom of the pool, and after a time, to the voice of the
bells were joined real words, sobbing to the rhythm: &lsquo;Virghea is
dead&mdash;is dead!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Ghicu Sina paused a while. Although he had only told me these things
quite briefly, I felt their secret had entered my soul; with my eyes
upon the pool where the strange reflections constantly played, I seemed
to hear, as one sometimes hears the faint voice of memory from a remote
past, the sound of the bells and their metallic words: &ldquo;Virghea
is dead&mdash;is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, the story adds, he rose from the pool. Like the wind, he
raised her in his arms and carried her deep down to his translucent
palace where, to this day, little fiery points of light burn round the
head of the dead woman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=

<h2 class="main">Old Nichifor, the Impostor</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. Creanga</span></p>
<p>Old Nichifor is not a character out of a story-book but a real man
like other men; he was once, when he was alive, an inhabitant of the
Tzutzuen quarter of the town of Neamtzu, towards the village of Neamtzu
Vinatori.</p>
<p>When old Nichifor lived in Tzutzuen my grandfather&rsquo;s
grandfather was piper at the christening feast at the house of Mosh
Dedui from Vinatori, the great Ciubar-Voda being godfather, to whom
Mosh Dedui gave forty-nine brown lambs with only one eye each; and the
priest, uncle of my mother&rsquo;s uncle, was Ciubuc the Bell-ringer
from the Neamtzu Monastery, who put up a big bell at this same
monastery at his own expense, and had a fancy to ring it all by himself
on big feast days, on which account he was called the bell-ringer.
About this time old Nichifor lived at Tzutzuen.</p>
<p>Old Nichifor was a cab-driver. Although his carriage was only
fastened together with thongs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>of lime and bark, it was
still a good carriage, roomy and comfortable. A hood of matting
prevented the sun and rain from beating down into old Nichifor&rsquo;s
carriage. In the well of the carriage hung a grease box with a greasing
stick and some screws which banged against each other ding! dong! ding!
dong! whenever the carriage moved. On a hook below the boot&mdash;on
the left&mdash;was suspended a little axe to be ready for any
emergency.</p>
<p>Two mares, white as snow and swift as flame, nearly always supported
the pole of the carriage; nearly always but not quite always; old
Nichifor was a horse-dealer, and when he got the chance he would either
exchange or sell a mare in the middle of a journey, and in that case
the pole would be bare on the one side. The old man liked to have
young, well-bred mares; it was a weakness with him. Perhaps you will
ask me why mares and always white ones, and I will tell you this:
mares, because old Nichifor liked to breed from them, white, because
the whiteness of the mares, he said, served him as a lantern on the
road at nights.</p>
<p>Old Nichifor was not among those who do not know that &ldquo;It is
not good to be coachman behind white horses or the slave of
women;&rdquo; he knew this, but the mares were his own, and when he
took care of them they were taken care of and when he did
not&mdash;well, there was no one to reproach him. Old Nichifor avoided
carrier&rsquo;s work; he refused to do any lifting for fear of giving
himself a rupture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cab driving,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is much better; one has
to deal with live goods who go up hill on foot, and down hill on foot,
and only stay in the carriage when it halts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nichifor had a whip of hemp twig, plaited by his own hand, with
a silk lash, which he cracked loud enough to deafen you. And whether he
had a full load or was empty, old Nichifor always walked up the hills
and usually pulled together with the mares. Down the hills he walked to
avoid laming the mares.</p>
<p>The passengers, willing or unwilling, had to do the same, for they
had enough of old Nichifor&rsquo;s tongue, who once rounded on one of
them like this: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get out and walk; the horse is
not like a blockhead that talks.&rdquo; If you only knew how to
appreciate everything that fell from old Nichifor&rsquo;s mouth, he was
very witty. If he met a rider on the road, he would ask: &ldquo;Left
the Prince far behind, warrior?&rdquo; and then, all at once, he would
whip up the mares, saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;White for the leader, white for the wheeler,</p>
<p class="line">The pole lies bare on the one side.</p>
<p class="line">Heigh! It&rsquo;s not far to Galatz. Heigh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But if he met women and young girls then he sang a
knowing song, rather like this:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When I took my old wife</p>
<p class="line">Eight lovers did sigh:</p>
<p class="line">Three women already wed,</p>
<p class="line">And five girls, in one village.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>They say, moreover, that one could not take the road, especially in
the month of May, with a pleasanter or gayer man. Only sometimes, when
you pretended not to see you were passing the door of a public house,
because you did not feel inclined to soften old Nichifor&rsquo;s
throat, did you find him in a bad mood, but even on these occasions he
would drive rapidly from one inn to the other. On one occasion,
especially, old Nichifor coveted two mares which were marvels on the
road, but at the inns, whether he wanted to or no, they used to halt,
for he had bought them from a priest.</p>
<p>My father said that some old men, who had heard it from old
Nichifor&rsquo;s own lips, had told him that at that time it was a good
business being a cab-driver in Neamtzu town. You drove from Varatic to
Agapia, from Agapia to Varatic, then to Razboeni; there were many
customers, too, at the church hostels. Sometimes you had to take them
to Peatra, sometimes to Folticeni, sometimes to the fair, sometimes to
Neamtzu Monastery, sometimes all about the place to the different
festivals.</p>
<p>My father also said he had heard from my grandfather&rsquo;s
grandfather that the then prior of Neamtzu is reported to have said to
some nuns who were wandering through the town during Holy Week:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your blessing, reverend Father!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not stay in the convent and meditate during
Passion Week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, reverend Father,&rdquo; they are said to have
replied with humility, &ldquo;this wool worries us, but for that we
should not come. Your Reverence knows we keep ourselves by selling
serge, and though we do not collect a great deal, still those who go
about get something to live on....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, they say, the prior gave a sigh, and he laid all the blame on
old Nichifor, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would the driver who brought you here might die, for then
he could not bring you so often to the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They say old Nichifor was greatly troubled in his mind when he heard
this, and that he swore an oath that as long as he lived he would never
again have dealings with the clergy, for, unfortunately, old Nichifor
was pious and was much afraid of falling under the ban of the priests.
He quickly went to the little monastery at Vovidenia to Chiviac, the
anchorite of St. Agura, who dyed his hair and beard with black
cherries, and on dry Friday he very devoutly baked an egg at a candle
that he might be absolved from his sins. And after this he decided that
from henceforth he would have more to do with the commercial side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The merchant,&rdquo; said old Nichifor, &ldquo;lives by his
business and for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was asked why, old Nichifor answered jokingly: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he has not got God for his master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nichifor was a wag among wags, there was no doubt of it, but
owing to all he had to put up with he became a bit disagreeable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what was the matter with her, but for some time
past, his old wife had begun to grumble; now this hurt her; now that
hurt her; now she had the ear-ache; now some one had cast a spell over
her; now she was in tears. She went from one old witch to the other to
get spells and ointments. As for old Nichifor, this did not suit him
and he was not at all at his ease; if he stayed two or three days at
home there was such bickering and quarrelling and ill will that his
poor old wife rejoiced to see him leave the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plain old Nichifor was made for the road, and that when
he was off it he was a different man; let him be able to crack his whip
and he was ready to chaff all the travellers he met and tell anecdotes
about all the chief places he passed through.</p>
<p>Early one day&mdash;it was the Wednesday before
Whit-Sunday&mdash;old Nichifor had taken a wheel off the carriage, and
was greasing it when suddenly Master Shtrul of Neamtzu town came up
behind him; he was a grocer; a dealer in ointments; he took in washing;
he traded in cosmetics, hair-dyes, toilet accessories, blue stone,
rouge or some good pomade for the face, palm branches, smelling salts
and other poisons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time there was no apothecary in Neamtzu town and Master
Shtrul to please the monks and nuns brought them all they wanted. Of
course he did other business too. To conclude, I hardly know how to
tell you, he was more important than the confessor, for without him the
monasteries could not have existed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mosh Nichifor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, Master Shtrul. What business brings you to
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter-in-law wants to go to Peatra. How much will you
charge to take her there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably she will have a great many packages like you do,
sir,&rdquo; said old Nichifor, scratching his head. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t matter; she can have them. My carriage is large; it can
hold a good deal. But without bargaining, Master Shtrul, you give me
sixteen shillings and a gold irmal and I&rsquo;ll take her there quite
easily; for you&rsquo;ll see, now I&rsquo;ve attended to it and put
some of this excellent grease into it, the carriage will run like a
spinning-wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be satisfied with nine shillings, Mosh Nichifor, and
my son will give you a tip when you get to Peatra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then; may God be with us, Master Shtrul. I am glad
the fair is in full swing just now; perhaps I shall get a customer for
the return journey. Now I would like to know when we have to
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, at once, Mosh Nichifor, if you are ready.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready, Master Shtrul; I have only to water the mares. Go
and get your daughter-in-law ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nichifor was energetic and quick at his work and he rapidly
threw some fodder into the carriage, spread out a couple of leather
cushions, put to the mares, flung his sheepskin cloak round his
shoulders, took his whip in his hand and was up and away. Master Shtrul
had scarcely reached home when old Nichifor drew up his carriage at the
door. Malca&mdash;that was the name of Master Shtrul&rsquo;s
daughter-in-law&mdash;came out to take a look at the driver.</p>
<p>This is Malca&rsquo;s story: it appeared that Peatra was her native
place; she was very red in the face, because she had been crying at
parting with her parents-in-law. It was the first time she had been in
Neamtzu; it was her wedding visit as they say with us. It was not much
more than two weeks since she had married Itzic, Master Shtrul&rsquo;s
son, or, it would be better to say, in all good fellowship, that Itzic
had married Malca. He had quitted his parents&rsquo; house according to
the custom, and in two weeks&rsquo; time Itzic had brought Malca to
Neamtzu and placed her in his parents&rsquo; hands and had returned
quickly to Peatra to look after his business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have kept your promise, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Master Shtrul; my word is my word. I don&rsquo;t
trouble myself much. As for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>journey, it&rsquo;s as well
to set out early and to halt in good time in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be able to reach Peatra by the evening, Mosh
Nichifor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! Do you know what you&rsquo;re talking about, Master
Shtrul? I expect, so help me God, to get your daughter-in-law to Peatra
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very experienced, Mosh Nichifor; you know better than
I do. All I beg of you is that you will be very careful to let no harm
befall my daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not start driving the day before yesterday, Master
Shtrul. I have already driven dames and nuns and noble ladies and other
honest girls, and, praise be to God, none have ever complained of me.
Only with the nun Evlampia, begging sister from Varatic, did I have a
little dispute. Wherever she went it was her custom to tie a cow to the
back of the carriage, for economy&rsquo;s sake, that she might have
milk on the journey; this caused me great annoyance. The cow, just like
a cow, pulled the forage out of my carriage, once it broke the rack,
going uphill it pulled back, and once it nearly strangled my mares. And
I, unhappy man that I am, was bold enough to say, &lsquo;Little nun,
isn&rsquo;t it being a penny wise and a pound foolish?&rsquo; Then she
looked sadly at me, and in a gentle voice said to me, &lsquo;Do not
speak so, Mosh Nichifor, do not speak thus of the poor little cow, for
she, poor thing, is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>guilty of anything. The anchorite
fathers of St. Agura have ordained that I should drink milk from a cow
only, so that I may not get old quickly; so what is to be done? I must
listen to them, for these holy men know a great deal better than do we
poor sinners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard this, I said to myself, that perhaps the begging
Sister had some reason on her side, and I left her to her fate, for I
saw that she was funny and at all events was determined to drink only
from one well. But, Master Shtrul, I do not think you are going to
annoy me with cows too. And, then, Mistress Malca, where it is very
steep, uphill or down, will always get out and walk a little way. It is
so beautiful out in the country then. But there, we mustn&rsquo;t waste
our time talking. Come, jump in, Mistress Malca, that I may take you
home to your husband; I know how sad it is for these young wives when
they have not got their husbands with them; they long for home as the
horse longs for his nose-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to come, Mosh Nichifor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she began at once to pick up the feather mattress, the soft
pillows, a bundle containing food, and other commodities. Then Malca
took leave of her parents-in-law, and got on to the feather mattresses
in the bottom of the carriage. Old Nichifor jumped on to the box,
whipped up the mares, and left Master Shtrul and his wife behind in
tears. Old Nichifor drove at a great pace <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>through the town, the
mares seemed to be almost flying. They passed the beach, the villages,
and the hill at Humuleshti in a second. From Ocea nearly to Grumazeshti
they went at the gallop.</p>
<p>But the other side of Grumazeshti old Nichifor took a pull from the
brandy flask which had come from Brashov, lit his pipe, and began to
let the mares go their own pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Mistress Malca, do you see that fine, large village? It
is called Grumazeshti. Were I to have as many bulls and you as many
sons as Cossacks, barbarians and other low people have dropped dead
there from time to time, it would be well for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant I may have sons, Mosh Nichifor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I have bulls, young lady&mdash;I have no hope of
having sons; my wife is an unfruitful vine; she has not been busy
enough to give me even one; may she die before long! When I am dead
there&rsquo;ll be nothing left but this battered old carriage and these
good-for-nothing mares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourself, Mosh Nichifor,&rdquo; said
Malca, &ldquo;maybe God has willed it so; because it is written in our
books, concerning some people, that only in their old age did they
beget sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me, Mistress Malca, with your books. I
know what I know; it&rsquo;s all in vain, we never can choose. I have
heard it said in our church that &lsquo;a tree that bears no fruit
should be hewn down and cast into the fire.&rsquo; Can one have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>anything clearer than that? Really, I wonder how
I can have had patience to keep house with my old woman so long. In
this respect you are a thousand times better off. If he does not give
you a child you&rsquo;ll get some one else. If that does not
do&mdash;why then another; and in due time will come a little blessing
from the Almighty. It&rsquo;s not like that with us who see ourselves
condemned to live with one barren stock to the end of our life with no
prospect of children. After all the great and powerful Lord was not
crucified for only one person in this world. Isn&rsquo;t it so, young
lady? If you have anything more to say, say it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so, Mosh Nichifor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear young lady, it is as I tell you. <i>Houp l&agrave;!</i>
We have gone a good part of the way. Lord, how a man forgets the road
when he&rsquo;s talking, and when one wakes up who knows where one has
got to. It&rsquo;s a good thing the Holy God has given one
companionship! Hi! daughters of a dragon, get on! Here is the
Grumazeshti Forest, the anxiety of merchants and the terror of the
boyars. Hei, Mistress Malca, if this forest had a mouth to tell what it
has seen, our ears could not hear more terrible adventures: I know we
should hear some things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has happened here, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, young lady, oh! God grant that what has been may never be
again! One used to have some trouble to pass through here without being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>robbed, thrashed or murdered. Of course this
happened more often by night than by day. As for me, up to now, I have
never spoken in an unlucky hour, God preserve me! Wolves and other wild
beasts have come out in front of me at different times, but I
didn&rsquo;t hurt them; I left them alone, I pretended not to see
anything, and they went about their own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mosh Nichifor, don&rsquo;t talk about wolves any more,
for they terrify me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have told you how amusing old Nichifor was; sometimes he would say
something that made you hold your sides with laughing, at other times
he would bring your heart into your mouth with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a wolf coming towards us, Mistress Malca!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me! Mosh Nichifor, where can I hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide where you are, for I can tell you one thing, I am not
afraid of the whole pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then poor Malca, terrified, clung round old Nichifor&rsquo;s neck,
and stuck to him like a leech, and as she sat there she said,
trembling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the wolf, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it? It crossed the road just in front of us, and
went into the wood again. But if you had strangled me, young lady, and
then the mares had bolted, it would have been a fine look
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely ceased speaking when Malca said softly: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell me again that a wolf is coming, Mosh Nichifor, I
shall die from fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that I say so; there is one just coming; there you
have one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again she hid close to old Nichifor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is young is young. You want to play, young lady,
isn&rsquo;t that it? It seems to me you&rsquo;re lucky, for I keep my
self-control. I am not very afraid of the wolf, but if some one else
had been in my place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more wolves will come, Mosh Nichifor, will
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! you are too funny, young lady, you want them to come too
often. You mustn&rsquo;t expect to see a wolf at every tree. On St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Day many of them prowl together in the same place and
the huntsmen are on the watch. During the great hunt, do you think
it&rsquo;s only a few wolves that are put to shame by having to leave
their skins as hostages? Now we will let the mares get their wind.
Look, this is &lsquo;Dragon Hill.&rsquo; Once an enormous dragon
alighted here, which spouted flames out of his mouth, and when it
whistled the forest roared, the valleys groaned, the wild beasts
trembled and beat their heads together with fear, and no one dared pass
by here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! And where is the dragon, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know, young lady? The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>forest is large, it knows where it has hidden
itself. Some say that after it had eaten a great many people and peeled
the bark off all the oaks in the wood it expired at this spot. By
others I have heard it said that it made a black cow give it milk, and
this enabled it to rise again into the skies whence it had fallen. But
how do I know whom to believe? People will say anything! Luckily I
understand witchcraft, and I am not at all afraid of dragons. I can
take serpents out of their nest as easily as you can take a flea out of
your poultry-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn these spells, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? My dear young lady, that I may not tell. My old
woman&mdash;she was just on twenty-four when I fell in love with
her&mdash;what hasn&rsquo;t she done! How she has worried me to tell
her, and I wouldn&rsquo;t tell her. And that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;ll
die when she does die, but why hasn&rsquo;t she died long before, for
then I could have got a younger woman. For three days I can live in
peace with her, and then it&rsquo;s enough to kill one! I am sick to
death of the old hag. Every minute she worries and reproaches me by her
manner. When I think that when I return I have got to go back to her, I
feel wild&mdash;just inclined to run away&mdash;nothing more nor
less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, Mosh Nichifor, you men are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! Mistress Malca, here we are near the top of the wood.
Won&rsquo;t you walk a little while we go <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>up the hill? I only
say it because I am afraid you will get stiff sitting in the carriage.
Look at the lovely flowers along the edge of the wood, they fill the
air with sweetness. It is really a pity for you to sit huddled up
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of the wolf, Mosh Nichifor,&rdquo; said Malca,
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have done with that wolf. Have you nothing else
to talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still that I may get down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wo! Step gently here on to the step of the carriage. Ah, now
I see for myself that you are sturdy; that&rsquo;s how I like people to
be, born not laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Malca gathered some balm to take to Itzic, old Nichifor stood
still and tinkered a little at the carriage. Then he called
quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready, young lady? Come, get in and let us get on
with the help of God; from here on it is mostly down hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Malca has mounted she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we a little late, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we meet with no obstacles I shall soon have you in
Peatra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he whipped up the mares, saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;White for the leader, white for the wheeler</p>
<p class="line">The pole lies bare on the one side.</p>
<p class="line">Heigh! It&rsquo;s not far to Galatz. Heigh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He had scarcely gone twenty yards when&mdash;bang! An
axle-pin broke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a to-do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me! Mosh Nichifor, we shall be benighted in the
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it amiss, Mistress Malca. Come, it&rsquo;s
only happened to me once in my life. While you eat a little something,
and the mares put away a bit of fodder, I shall have replaced the
axle-pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When old Nichifor came to look at the hook, the little axe had
disappeared!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what has been had to be,&rdquo; said old Nichifor,
knitting his eyebrows, and getting angry as he thought of it. &ldquo;If
God punishes the old woman, may he punish her! See how she takes care
of me; there is no axe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When poor Malca heard this she began to sigh and to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosh Nichifor, what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young lady, don&rsquo;t lose heart, for I have still a
ray of hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his pocket-knife out of its sheath, he went to the side of
the carriage, and began to cut away at a young oak of the previous
year. He cut it as best he could, then he began to rummage about in a
box in the carriage to find some rope; but how could he find it if it
had not been put in? After looking and looking in vain, he cut the cord
from the nose-bag, and a strap from the bridle of one of the mares to
tie the sapling where it was wanted, put the wheel in position, slipped
in the bit of wood which ran from the head of the axle to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>the
staff-side of the carriage, twisted round the chain which connected the
head of the axle with the shaft, and tied it to the step; then he lit
his pipe and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, my dear young lady, how necessity teaches a man what to
do. With old Nichifor of Tzutzuen no one comes to grief on the road.
But from now on sit tight in the bottom of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e2391" title="Source: carrriage">carriage</span>, and hold fast to
the back of your seat, for I must take these mares in hand and make
them gallop. Yes, I warrant you, my old woman won&rsquo;t have an easy
time when I get home. I&rsquo;ll play the devil with her and teach her
how to treat her husband another time, for &lsquo;a woman who has not
been beaten is like a broken mill.&rsquo; Hold tight, Mistress Malca!
<i>Houp-l&agrave;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at once the mares began to gallop, the wheels to go round, and
the dust to whirl up into the sky. But in a few yards the sapling began
to get hot and brittle and&mdash;off came the wheel again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Everything is contrary! It&rsquo;s evident I crossed a
priest early this morning or the devil knows what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosh Nichifor, what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall do what we shall do, young lady. But now stay quiet
here, and don&rsquo;t speak a word. It&rsquo;s lucky this didn&rsquo;t
happen somewhere in the middle of the fields. Praise be to God, in the
forest there is enough wood and to spare. Perhaps some one will catch
us up who can lend me an axe.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>And as he spoke he
saw a man coming towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well met, good man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So your carriage has broken the road!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put chaff aside, man; it would be better if you came and
helped me to mend this axle, for you can see my heart&rsquo;s breaking
with my ill luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am in a hurry to get to Oshlobeni. You&rsquo;ll have to
lament in the forest to-night; I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll die of
boredom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed of you,&rdquo; said Nichifor sulkily. &ldquo;You
are older than I am and yet you have such ideas in your
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, good man, I was only joking. Good
luck! The Lord will show you what to do.&rdquo; And on he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Mistress Malca, what people the devil has put in this
world! He is only out to steal. If there had been a barrel of wine or
brandy about, do you think he would have left the carriage stuck in the
middle of the road all that time? But I see, anything there is to do
must be done by old Nichifor. We must have another try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he began to cut another sapling. He tried and he tried
till he got that, too, into place. Then he whipped up the mares and
once more trotted a little way, but at the first slope, the axle-pin
broke again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mistress Malca, I must say the same as that man, we
shall have to spend the night in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Woe is me! Woe is me! Mosh Nichifor, what are you
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am saying what is obvious to my eyes. Look yourself;
can&rsquo;t you see the sun is going down behind the hill, and we are
still in the same place? It is nothing at all, so don&rsquo;t worry. I
know of a clearing in the wood quite near here. We will go there, and
we shall be just as though we were at home. The place is sheltered and
the mares can graze. You&rsquo;ll sleep in the carriage, and I shall
mount guard all night. The night soon passes, we must spend it as best
we can, but I will remind my old woman all the rest of her days of this
misfortune, for it is her fault that things have gone so with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do what you think best, Mosh Nichifor; it&rsquo;s sure
to be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, young lady, don&rsquo;t take it too much to heart, for
we shall be quite all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at once old Nichifor unharnessed the mares and, turning the
carriage, he drew it as well as he could, till he reached the
clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Malca, it is like a paradise straight from God here;
where one lives for ever, one never dies! But you are not accustomed to
the beauty of the world. Let us walk a little bit while we can still
see, for we must collect sticks to keep <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>enough fire going all
night to ward off the mosquitoes and gnats in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Malca saw it was all one now. She began to walk about and
collect sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! you look pretty, young lady. It seems as though you are
one of us. Didn&rsquo;t your father once keep an inn in the village
somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time he kept the inn at Bodesti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was wondering how you came to speak Moldavian so well
and why you looked like one of our women. I cannot believe you were
really afraid of the wolf. Well, well, what do you think of this
clearing? Would you like to die without knowing the beauty of the
world? Do you hear the nightingales, how charming they are? Do you hear
the turtle-doves calling to each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosh Nichifor, won&rsquo;t something happen to us this
evening? What will Itzic say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Itzic? Itzic will think himself a lucky man when he sees you
at home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Itzic knows the world? Or what sort of accidents
could happen on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He only knows how to walk about his hearth or by the oven
like my worn-out old woman at home. Let me see whether you know how to
make a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malca arranged the sticks; old Nichifor drew out the tinder box and
soon had a flame. Then old Nichifor said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see, Mistress Malca, how beautifully the wood
burns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Mosh Nichifor, but my heart is throbbing with
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! you will excuse me, but you seem to belong to the Itzic
breed. Pluck up a little courage! If you are so timid, get into the
carriage, and go to sleep: the night is short, daylight soon
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malca, encouraged by old Nichifor, got into the carriage and lay
down; old Nichifor lighted his pipe, spread out his sheepskin cloak and
stretched himself by the side of the fire and puffed away at his pipe,
and was just going off to sleep when a spark flew out on to his
nose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn! That must be a spark from the sticks Malca picked up;
it has burnt me so. Are you asleep, Mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I was sleeping a little, Mosh Nichifor, but I had a
nightmare and woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been unlucky too; a spark jumped out on to my nose and
frightened sleep away or I might have slept all night. But can anyone
sleep through the mad row these nightingales are making? They seem to
do it on purpose. But then, this is their time for making love to each
other. Are you asleep, young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I was going to sleep, Mosh Nichifor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, young lady, I think I will put out the fire now
at once: I have just remembered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>that those wicked wolves
prowl about and come after smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it out, Mosh Nichifor, if that&rsquo;s the
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nichifor at once began to put dust on the fire to smother
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on, Mistress Malca, you can sleep without anxiety
till the day dawns. There! I&rsquo;ve put out the fire and forgotten to
light my pipe. But I&rsquo;ve got the tinder box. The devil take you
nightingales: I know too well you make love to each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Nichifor sat thinking deeply until he had finished his pipe,
then he rose softly and went up to the carriage on the tips of his
toes.</p>
<p>Malca had begun to snore a little. Old Nichifor shook her gently and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Malca! Mistress Malca!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear, Mosh Nichifor,&rdquo; replied Malca, trembling and
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve been thinking as I sat by the
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you have gone to sleep, I will mount one of the mares,
hurry home, fetch an axle-pin and axe, and by daybreak I shall be back
here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me! Mosh Nichifor, what are you saying? Do you want to
find me dead from fright when you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God preserve you from such a thing! Don&rsquo;t be
frightened, I was only talking at random.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mosh Nichifor, from now on I shall not want to sleep;
I shall get down and sit by you all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look after yourself, young lady; you sit quietly where
you are, for you are comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as she spoke down she came and sat on the grass by old Nichifor.
And first one, and then the other was overcome by sleep, till both were
slumbering profoundly. And when they woke it was broad daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Mistress Malca, here&rsquo;s the blessed day! Get up and
come and see what&rsquo;s to be done. There, no one has eaten you, have
they? Only you have had a great fright!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malca fell asleep again at these words. But old Nichifor, like a
careful man, got up into the carriage, and began rummaging about all
over the place, and under the forage bags, and what should there be but
the axe and a measure and a gimlet beneath the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would have believed it! Here&rsquo;s a pity! I was
wondering why my old woman didn&rsquo;t take care of me. Now because I
wronged her so terribly I must take her back a red fez and a bag of
butter to remind her of our youth. Evidently I took them out yesterday
with my pipe. But my poor, good old wife, difficult though she is, knew
all I should want on the journey, only she did not put them in their
right place. But the woman tried to understand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>all
her husband wanted! Mistress Malca! Mistress Malca!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that I have found the axe, and the rope and the
gimlet and everything I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Mosh Nichifor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, under your bundles. Only they had no mouths with which
to tell me. We have made a mistake: we have been like some one sitting
on hidden treasure and asking for alms. But it&rsquo;s good that we
have found them now. It shows my poor old woman did put them
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosh Nichifor, you are feeling remorse in your
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, young lady. I see I am at fault. I must sing a
song of penitence:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Poor old wife of mine!</p>
<p class="line">Be she kind or be she harsh,</p>
<p class="line">Still her home is mine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And so saying old Nichifor rolled up his sleeves, cut
a beech stick, and made a wonderful axle-pin. Then he set it in
position, put the wheel in place, harnessed the mares, quietly took the
road and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In you get, young lady, and let&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the mares were refreshed and well rested they were at Peatra by
middle day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you will see your home, Mistress Malca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, Mosh Nichifor, that I came to no harm in the
forest.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, young lady, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it,
there&rsquo;s no place like home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while they were talking they reached the door of Itzic&rsquo;s
house. Itzic had only just come back from the school, and when he saw
Malca he was beside himself with joy. But when he heard all about the
adventures they had met with and how the Almighty had delivered them
from danger he did not know how to thank old Nichifor enough. What did
he not give him! He himself marvelled at all that was given him. The
next day old Nichifor went back with other customers. And when he
reached home he was so gay that his old woman wondered what he had been
doing, for he was more drunk than he had been for a long time.</p>
<p>From now on Malca came every two or three weeks to visit her
parents-in-law in Neamtzu: she would only let old Nichifor take her
back home, and she was never again afraid of wolves.</p>
<p>A year, or perhaps several years, after, over a glass of wine, old
Nichifor whispered to one of his friends the story of the adventure in
the &ldquo;Dragon&rdquo; Wood, and the fright Mistress Malca got. Old
Nichifor&rsquo;s friend whispered it again to some friends of his own,
and then people, the way people will do, began to give old Nichifor a
nickname and say: &ldquo;Nichifor, the Impostor: Nichifor, the
Impostor:&rdquo; and even though he is dead the poor man has kept the
name of Nichifor, the Impostor, to this very day. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Cozma Racoare</h2>
<h2 class="main"></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By M. Sadoveanu</span></p>
<p>He was a terrible man, Cozma Racoare!</p>
<p>When I say Cozma, I seem to see, do you know, I seem to see before
me, a sinister-looking man riding upon a bay horse; two eyes like steel
pierce through me; I see a moustache like twin sparrows. Fierce Rouman!
He rode with a gun across his back, and with a knife an ell long, here,
in his belt, on the left side. It was thus I always saw him. I am old,
you know, nigh on a hundred, I have travelled much about the world, I
have met various characters, and many people, but I tell you, a man
like Cozma Racoare I have never seen! Yet he was not physically so
terrible; he was a man of middle height, lean, with a brown face, a man
like many another&mdash;ha! but all the same! only to have seen the
eyes was to remember him. Terrible Rouman!</p>
<p>There was grief and bitterness in the land at that time. Turks and
Greeks were overrunning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the country on all sides,
everywhere honest men were complaining&mdash;they were hard times!
Cozma had no cares. To-day he was here, to-morrow one heard of him, who
knows where! Every one fled before the storm, but he, good Lord, he
never cared! They caught him and put him in chains. What need? He just
shook himself, wrenched the bars with one hand, whistled to his horse,
and there he was on the road again. Who did not know that Racoare had a
charmed life? Ah, how many bullets were aimed at his breast! But in
vain! It was said of him: only a silver bullet can slay him! Where do
you see men like that nowadays? Those times are gone for ever.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the Feciorul Romancei? He was a fire-eater too! He
robbed the other side of Muntenia, Cozma robbed this, and one
night&mdash;what a night!&mdash;they both met at Milcov, exchanged
booty, and were back in their homes before dawn. Were the frontier
guards on the watch? Did they catch them as they rode? Why!
Racoare&rsquo;s horse flew like a phantom, no bullet could touch him!
What a road that is from here, across the mountains of Bacau, to the
frontier! Eh! to do it, there and back in one night, you mark my words,
that&rsquo;s no joke! But that horse! That&rsquo;s the truth of the
matter, that horse of Racoare&rsquo;s was not like any other horse.
That&rsquo;s clear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>Voda-Calimbach had an Arabian mare, which his servants watched as
the apple of his eye; she was due to foal. One night&mdash;it was in
the seventh month&mdash;Cozma got into the stall, ripped open the mare
and stole the foal. But that was not all he did! You understand the
foal was wrapped in a caul. Racoare cut the caul, but he cut it in such
a way as to split the foal&rsquo;s nostrils. And look, the foal with
the split nostrils grew up in the dark fed upon nut kernels; and when
Cozma mounted it&mdash;well, that was a horse!</p>
<p>Even the wind, therefore, could not out-distance Cozma. On one
occasion&mdash;I was a volunteer then&mdash;Cozma woke to find himself
within the walls of Probot, with volunteers inside and the Turks
outside. The Turks were battering the walls with their guns. The
volunteers decided to surrender the fortress. Cozma kept his own
counsel. The next day Cozma was nowhere to be found. But from the
walls, up to the forest of Probot, was a line of corpses! That had been
Racoare&rsquo;s road!</p>
<p>That is how it always was! His were the woods and fields! He
recognized no authority, he did not know what fear was, nor
love&mdash;except on one occasion. Terrible Rouman! It seems to me I
can see him now, riding upon his bay horse.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that time a Greek was managing the Vulturesht estate, and on this
side, on our estate, within those ruined walls, there ruled such a minx
of a Roumanian as I had never seen before. The Greek was pining for the
Roumanian. And no wonder! The widow had eyebrows that met, and the eyes
of the devil&mdash;Lord! Lord! such eyes would have tempted a saint.
She had been married, against her will, to a Greek, to Dimitru Covas;
the Greek died, and now the lady ruled alone over our estate.</p>
<p>As I tell you, Nicola Zamfiridi, the Greek, was dying for the lady.
What did that man not do, where did he not go, what soothsayers did he
not visit, all in vain! The lady would not hear of it! She hated the
Greek. And yet Nicola was not ill-favoured. He was a proud Greek,
bronzed, with pointed moustache and curly beard. But still he did not
please the widow!</p>
<p>One day, Nicola sat pondering in his room while he smoked. What was
to be done? He most certainly wanted to marry, and to take her for his
wife; why would she not hear of it?</p>
<p>A few days before he had gone with Ciocirlie, the gipsy, and had
sung desperately outside the walls. Alas, the courtyard remained still
as stone! What the devil was to be done?</p>
<p>Boyar Nicola thought to himself: &ldquo;You are not ugly, you are
not stupid&mdash;what&rsquo;s the reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of it? Is she,
perhaps, in love with some one else?&rdquo; No. He watched for one
whole night. Nobody entered, and nobody left the courtyard.</p>
<p>The boyar was angry. He rose, picked up a whip and went out. The
grooms were grooming the horses in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that horse supposed to be groomed?&rdquo; he shouted, and
slash! down came the whip on one of the grooms.</p>
<p>Farther on the gardener was resting from the heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this how you look after the garden? Hey!&rdquo; and swish!
crack!</p>
<p>What next? Was it any use losing one&rsquo;s temper with the people?
He went into the garden, and seated himself under a beautiful
lime-tree. There, on the stone bench, he pondered again. His life was
worthless if the woman he loved would not look at him! He watched the
flight of the withered leaves in the still air; he heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vasile! Vasile!&rdquo; called the boyar. His voice rang sadly
in the melancholy garden.</p>
<p>A sturdy old man came through the garden door, and went towards his
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vasile,&rdquo; said the boyar, &ldquo;what is to be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man eyed his master, then he, too, sighed and scratched his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done, Vasile?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must find something. Many people have advised me, now you
suggest something. I got nothing out of that old witch, and Ciocirlie
was no good; cannot you propose something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not desert me, Vasile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, master, I&rsquo;ll tell you something if you will
give me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a ducat of mine, Vasilica&mdash;speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vasile did not let himself be put off by the mention of one ducat.
He scratched his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew you would give me two ducats, master, or even
three, or many&mdash;you understand&mdash;that&rsquo;s how it is! What
will be, will be! I say go right off to Frasini, go into the courtyard,
through the courtyard into the lady&rsquo;s boudoir and steal her!
That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, good Vasile! Is it
possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vasile said no more. The boyar thought deeply, his hand on his
forehead; then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I must do, Vasile! I know what I have to
do! Bravo you, good Vasile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I knew I was to get two ducats reward!&rdquo; sighed
Vasile, scratching his head.</p>
<p>And that evening Boyar Nicola kept his word. He mounted his horse,
took with him five companions from among the grooms, and started out to
Frasini. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>The forest shuddered with the whisper of the breeze of the autumn
night. The men rode silently. From time to time could be heard the
trumpeting of the cock, coming they knew not whence. Beyond lay
silence. At last the widow&rsquo;s courtyard came into sight, black,
like some heap of coal.</p>
<p>Like ghosts Nicola and his companions approached the wall; in
silence they dismounted; they threw rope-ladders over the top of the
wall, climbed up and over to the other side. The horses remained tied
to the trees.</p>
<p>Suddenly they heard cries. Boyar Nicola was not afraid. He hurried
to the door&mdash;the doors were not shut. He passed along the
corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; murmured the Greek. &ldquo;Now I shall have the
darling in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But suddenly a door was opened, and a bright sea of light
illuminated the passage. Boyar Nicola was not frightened. He advanced
towards the room. But he had scarcely gone two paces when there, on the
threshold, stood the Sultana, with her hair undone, in a thin white
petticoat and a white dressing-jacket. With frowning brows she stood in
the doorway looking at the boyar.</p>
<p>Nicola was beside himself. He would willingly have gone on his
knees, and kissed her feet, so beautiful was she. But he knew if he
knelt before her she would only mock him. He approached to embrace
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried the Sultana. &ldquo;I thought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>there were thieves! Ha, ha! it is you, Boyar
Nicola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly, there in the light, she raised a shining scimitar in
her right hand. Nicola felt a hard blow on the side of his head. He
stood still. His grooms started to run, but one fell, yelling, and
covered with blood. Just then a great noise was heard, and the
lady&rsquo;s servants came in.</p>
<p>Nicola fled towards the exit followed by his four companions. Then
on into the yard with scimitars flashing on their right and on their
left. And once more they are on horseback fleeing towards
Vulturesht.</p>
<p>There he dismounted, feeling very bitter, and entered the garden
once more, and once more sat on the stone bench, and hid his face in
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; he murmured miserably. &ldquo;How wretched
is my life! What is to be done? What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat there in the October night tortured by his thoughts. Only the
breeze carrying the mist from the fields disturbed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me! How wretched is my life!&rdquo; and he bent
forward, his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. &ldquo;What a
terrible woman!&rdquo; he murmured again as he mused. &ldquo;What eyes
she has! Oh, Blessed Virgin! Oh, Blessed Virgin! Do not abandon me, for
my heart is breaking!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>For some time he stayed there dreaming. After a while he rose and
moved towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a terrible woman, and what eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the house he once more called for Vasile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Vasile, I am undone! A terrible woman, good
Vasile&mdash;she has burnt my heart and turned it to ashes! What is to
be done? Do not leave me! Look, you understand, you shall have two of
my ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you have been through, master. She is a proud
lady, there is no denying it! If I knew you would give me five ducats,
or even six&mdash;but there, it&rsquo;s only an
idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Vasile, good man, I will give you&mdash;&mdash; What
eyes! Woe is me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I understand, master,&rdquo; says Vasile, &ldquo;that
you give me seven ducats, but you&rsquo;ll have to give seven times
seven if you get her here at your hand&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid,
master, it is not much&mdash;only seven times seven to have her here at
your hand! I&rsquo;ll bring Cozma Racoare to you! As sure as you put
the ducats into the palm of my hand, so sure will he put the Sultana
into your arms, that&rsquo;s that<span class="corr" id="xd19e2702"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boyar Nicola was rather alarmed when he heard talk of Cozma Racoare,
but afterwards he sighed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later Racoare came. Nicola was sitting on the stone bench
in the garden under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>lime-tree, smoking a pipe of
fragrant tobacco. When he caught sight of the highwayman he sat gazing
at him with startled eyes. Cozma came calmly along with his
horse&rsquo;s bridle in his left hand. He wore top boots up to his
knees with long steel spurs. A long gun was slung across his back. On
his head was a black sheepskin cap. He walked unconcernedly as usual
with knitted brows; his horse followed him with bent head.</p>
<p>Vasile, the boyar&rsquo;s agent, came up to the stone seat,
scratching his head, and whispered with a grin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to this, master? Just take a look at him. He
could bring you the devil himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boyar Nicola could not take his eyes off Cozma. The highwayman
stopped and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; replied Vasile. &ldquo;God grant
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boyar remained persistently silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; murmured Vasile. &ldquo;You have come to
see us, friend Cozma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; responded Racoare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cozma spoke slowly, frowning; wherever he might be no smile ever lit
up his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, you have come,&rdquo; said the boyar, as if awaking
from sleep. &ldquo;Vasile, go and tell them to prepare coffee, but
bring wine at once.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them make coffee for one,&rdquo; said Cozma, &ldquo;I
never drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vasile went off grinning, after a side-glance at his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you never drink!&rdquo; said the boyar with an effort.
&ldquo;So, so, you have come on our business&mdash;how much? Ah, I am
giving fifty ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Racoare quietly.</p>
<p>Vasile returned, smiling knowingly. The boyar was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh,&rdquo; said Vasile, scratching his head, &ldquo;how are
you getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Vasile, go and fetch the purse from under my
pillow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no need to give me a purse,&rdquo; said the
highwayman, &ldquo;I have no need of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; murmured the boyar. &ldquo;Ah, yes! You do not
need? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is to put the Sultana of Frasini into your
arms&mdash;I hand you over the lady, and you hand me the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be brief!&rdquo; cried Vasile, passing his hand
through his hair. &ldquo;One party gives the lady, the other the money.
What did I tell you? Cozma would fetch you the devil from hell. From
henceforth the lady is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racoare turned round, strode to the bottom of the garden, fastened
his horse to a tree, drew a cloak of serge from his saddle, spread it
out and wrapped himself in it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well!&rdquo; groaned Boyar Nicola, breathing heavily.
&ldquo;What a terrible man! But I feel as though he had taken a load
off my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vasile smiled but said nothing. Later, when he was by himself, he
began to laugh and whisper: &ldquo;Ha, ha! He who bears a charmed life
is a lucky man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boyar started up as from sleep and looked fearfully at Vasile;
then he shook his head and relapsed into thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; he murmured, without understanding what he
was talking about.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>When night had fallen Cozma Racoare tightened his horse&rsquo;s
girths and mounted. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boyar, wait for me in the glade at Vulturesht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gates were opened, the horse snorted and rushed forth like a
dragon.</p>
<p>The full moon shone through the veil of an autumnal mist, weaving
webs of light, lighting up the silent hills and the dark woods. The
rapid flight of the bay broke the deep silence. Racoare rode silently
under the overhanging woods with their sparse foliage; he seemed like a
phantom in the blue light.</p>
<p>Then he reached Frasini. Every one was asleep, the doors were shut.
Cozma knocked at the door: Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; cried a voice from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; said Racoare. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; shouted Cozma.</p>
<p>From within was heard a whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not open!&rdquo; &ldquo;Open, it is
Cozma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light shone through a niche in the wall above the door, and
lighted up Cozma&rsquo;s face. Then a rustling sound became audible,
the light was extinguished, and the bar across the door rattled.</p>
<p>Cozma entered the empty courtyard, dismounted by the steps, and
pushed open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is open,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;the lady is not
nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark corridor his footsteps and his spurs echoed as in a
church. A noise was heard in one of the rooms, and a bright light shone
into the passage. The Sultana appeared in the doorway, dressed in white
with her hair unplaited, with frowning brows and the scimitar in her
right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to fetch you,&rdquo; said Racoare shortly,
&ldquo;and take you to Boyar Nicola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are not burglars?&rdquo; said the lady, and raised
her scimitar. &ldquo;See here, you will meet the same fate as your
Nicola!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Racoare took a step forward, calmly seized the scimitar, squeezed
the lady&rsquo;s fist, and the steel blade flew into a corner. The lady
sprang quickly back, calling: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Gavril! Niculai! Toader! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices were heard, and the servants crowded into the passage, and
stood by the door. Racoare approached the lady, and tried to seize her.
She avoided him, and caught up a knife from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, you boobies? Help! Seize him, bind
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense&mdash;I see you are not frightened;
I cannot do other than I am doing!&rdquo; said Racoare.</p>
<p>Then the servants murmured again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we bind him? It is Racoare. He is here! Cozma
Racoare, lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; cried the lady, and threw herself upon
Cozma.</p>
<p>The highwayman took her arm, pressed her hands together, tied them
with a leather strap, and lifted her under his arm like a bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo; he said then, and the people fell
over each other as they scattered to either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pearl among women!&rdquo; thought Cozma, while he
strode along the corridor with the lady under his arm, &ldquo;he has
not bad taste, that Boyar Nicola! Proud woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultana looked with eyes wide with horror at the servants who
gave way on either hand in their terror. She felt herself held as in a
vice. At last she raised her eyes to Racoare&rsquo;s fierce face.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>The light from the room was reflected in the
man&rsquo;s steely eyes, and lit up his weather-beaten face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Cozma Racoare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady gave another glance at the servants huddled in the corners,
and she said not another word. Now she understood.</p>
<p>Outside, the highwayman mounted the bay, placed the lady in front of
him, and set spurs to his horse. Once more the sound of the galloping
horse broke the silence of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pearl among women!&rdquo; thought Racoare, and the
horse sped along the road like a phantom.</p>
<p>The lady turned her head, and studied Racoare by the light of the
moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you look at me like that, lady?&rdquo; And the horse
sped along under the overhanging woods.</p>
<p>The black hair of the lady shone in great billows of light. The
foliage glistened with hoar-frost, like silver-leaf. The lady looked at
the highwayman and shuddered, she felt herself squeezed in his powerful
arms, and her eyes burnt like two stars beneath the heavy knitted
brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you look at me like that, lady? Why do you shiver? Are
you cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The galloping hooves thundered through the glades, the leaves
glittered in their silver sheen, and the bay passed on like a phantom
in the light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>A shadow suddenly appeared in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that yonder?&rdquo; questioned the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boyar Nicola awaits us there,&rdquo; replied Racoare.</p>
<p>The lady said no more. But Cozma felt her stiffen herself. The
leather strap was snapped, and two white hands were lifted up. The
highwayman had no time to stop her. Like lightning she seized the
bridle in her right hand, and turned the horse on the spot, but her
left arm she twined round Racoare&rsquo;s neck. The highwayman felt the
lady&rsquo;s head resting against his breast, and a voice murmured
softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you give me to another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the horse flew like a phantom through the blue light; the
meadows rang with the sound of the galloping hooves, the silver leaves
glistened, and tresses of black hair floated in the wind. But now
shadows seemed to be pursuing them. The hills on the horizon seemed
peopled with strange figures, which hurried through the light mist. But
the black phantom sped on, and ever onwards, till it was lost in the
far distance, in the gloom of the night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Wanderers</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By M. Sadoveanu</span></p>
<p>A house stood isolated in the middle of a garden, separated from the
main group about the market-place.</p>
<p>It was an old house, its veranda was both high and broad and had big
whitewashed pillars. The pointed roof was tiled and green with moss. In
front of the veranda, and facing south, stood two beautiful round
lime-trees throwing out their shade.</p>
<p>One day in the month of August, the owners, Vladimir Savicky and
Ana, his wife, were sitting in the veranda. Both were old,
weather-beaten by the storms of many journeys and the misfortunes of
life. The old man wore a long white beard and long white hair, which
was parted down the middle and smooth on the top; he smoked a very long
pipe, and his blue eyes gazed towards the plains which stretched away
towards the sunset. The old woman, Ana, selected a nosegay of flowers
from a basket. He was tall and vigorous still, she was slight with
gentle movements. Forty years ago <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>they left their ruined
Poland, and settled in our country. They kept an adopted daughter, and
had a son of thirty years of age, a bachelor, and a good craftsman.
They had lived for thirty years here in the old house, busying
themselves with market-gardening: for thirty years they had lived a
sad, monotonous life in this place. They had been alone with their
adopted child, with Magdalena; Roman, their boy, had been roaming
through the world for the last ten years.</p>
<p>Old Vladimir puffed away at his pipe as he stroked his beard; the
warmth of the afternoon had made him lay aside his blue jacket. The old
wife was choosing her flowers. A gentle breeze, laden with fragrance,
came from the garden, from the trees heavy with fruit, and from the
gay-coloured flowers. Shafts of light penetrated through the leafy
limes, little patches of white light came from above, and played over
the bright grass, green as the tree-frog. From time to time the
quivering foliage sent a melodious rustle into the peaceful
balcony.</p>
<p>At intervals the soft notes of a song floated through the open
window.</p>
<p>Suddenly a resounding noise broke the stillness of the day. What was
it? A carriage. The old man started, put down his pipe, and rose. The
old woman put her head, wrapped in a white shawl, out over the
railings. The rumbling vehicle, an ugly Jew upon the box, drew nearer,
and pulled up outside the door of the old house. A strong,
broad-shouldered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>young man descended, a big bundle in his
right hand, a case in his left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman! Roman!&rdquo; cried the old lady in a feeble voice.
She tried to rise but fell softly back beside the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, old lady, it is Roman,&rdquo; murmured the old
man gaily, as he went down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Roman!&rdquo; cried a gentle voice, and Magdalena&rsquo;s
fair head appeared at the window.</p>
<p>Roman had let fall the bundle and thrown himself into his
father&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old lady, it is Roman!&rdquo; murmured Vladimir Savicky,
with tears in his eyes. He embraced his son, and pressed him to his
heart. &ldquo;Yes, old lady, it is Roman!&rdquo; That was all he could
find to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;I have not seen
you for ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old mother cried silently, her son strained her to his breast,
while the old man wandered round murmuring tearfully into his
beard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, old lady, it is our Roman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Roman Savicky straightened his strong frame and turned round, he
saw a white face with blue eyes in the doorway. He stood transfixed
with astonishment; the girl watched him, smiling shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed old Savicky, &ldquo;how now? Do you
not know each other? Ah! Kiss each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>other, you have known
Magdalena ever since she was a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people approached each other in silence, the girl offered
her cheek with eyelids lowered, and Roman kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not recognize her,&rdquo; said Roman, &ldquo;she has
grown so big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother laughed softly. &ldquo;You, too, Roman, you have grown
much bigger&mdash;and handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally <i>our</i> Roman is handsome,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;our own Roman, old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the mother kissed her son. Roman seated himself upon a chair
in the veranda, the old man placed himself on his right, and the mother
on the left; they watched him, feasting their eyes upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! my darling!&rdquo; he said to the old woman,
&ldquo;it is long since I have seen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end they grew silent, looking intently at one another,
smiling. The gentle rustle of the lime trees broke the heat and
stillness of the August day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence do you come, Roman?&rdquo; questioned the old man
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Warsaw,&rdquo; said his son, raising his head.</p>
<p>The old man opened wide his eyes, then he turned towards Ana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, old lady, from Warsaw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady nodded her head, and said wonderingly: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;From Warsaw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Roman, &ldquo;I have journeyed throughout
Poland, full of bitterness, and I have wandered among our exiled
brothers in all parts of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Profound misery rang in his powerful voice. The old people looked
smilingly at him, lovingly, but without understanding him. All acute
feeling for their country had long ago died away in their hearts. They
sat looking happily into the blue eyes of their Roman, at his fair,
smooth face, at his beautiful luxuriant hair.</p>
<p>The young man began to speak. Gradually his voice rose, it rang
powerfully, full of sorrow and bitterness. Where had he not been! He
had been everywhere, and everywhere he had met exiled Poles, pining
away among strangers, dying far from the land of their fathers.
Everywhere the same longing, everywhere the same sorrow. Tyrants ruled
over the old hearth, the cry of the oppressed rent the air, patriots
lay in chains or trod the road to Siberia, crowds fled from the homes
of their fathers, strangers swept like a flood into their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman, Roman!&rdquo; said the old woman, bursting into tears,
&ldquo;how beautifully you talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully talks our Roman, old lady,&rdquo; said Vladimir
Savicky sadly, &ldquo;beautifully, but he brings us sad
tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the old man&rsquo;s soul old longings and bitter memories
began to stir. On the threshold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>Magdalena stood dismayed and
shuddered as she looked at Roman.</p>
<p>Suddenly two old men entered by the door. One had thick, grizzled
whiskers, the other a long beard in which shone silver threads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried the old Savicky, &ldquo;here comes
Palchevici, here comes Rujancowsky. Our Roman has come! Here he
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; said Rujancowsky gravely, &ldquo;we have seen
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we have seen him,&rdquo; murmured Palchevici.</p>
<p>They both approached and shook Roman warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day and welcome to you! See, now all the Poles of this
town are met together in one place,&rdquo; said Rujancowsky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; questioned Roman. &ldquo;Only these few are
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others have passed away,&rdquo; said old Savicky
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have passed away,&rdquo; murmured Palchevici,
running his fingers through his big grey whiskers.</p>
<p>They were all silent for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old lady,&rdquo; said Vladimir Savicky, &ldquo;go and fetch a
bottle of wine and get something to eat too, perhaps Roman is hungry.
But where are you? Where is Ana?&rdquo; asked the old man, looking at
Magdalena. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not worry, she has gone to get things ready,&rdquo;
replied the girl smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well! &rsquo;tis well!&rdquo; Then turning towards
the two Poles. &ldquo;You do not know how Roman can talk. You should
hear him. Roman, you must say it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old wife came with wine and cold meat. She placed meat in front
of her boy, and the wine before the older men. They all began to talk.
But Roman&rsquo;s voice sounded melancholy in the stillness of the
summer day. Then they began to drink to Roman&rsquo;s health, to the
health of each one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Poland!&rdquo; cried Roman excitedly, striking the table
with his fist. And then he began to speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize how the downtrodden people begin to murmur and
to agitate? Soon there will rise a mighty storm which will break down
the prison walls, the note of liberty will ring through our native
land! Ah, you do not know the anguish and the bitterness <i>there</i>!
Stranger-ridden and desolate! Since Kosciusko died there are exiles and
desolation everywhere! Mother,&rdquo; cried Roman, then turning towards
the old woman, &ldquo;give me the case from over there, I must sing
something to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words his eyes darkened and he stared into space. The old
people looked at him, much moved, their heads upon their breasts, not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>speaking a word. Quiet reigned in the old house,
and in the garden there was peace; a fiery sunset, crowned with clouds
of flame, was merging into the green sea of the woods. Golden rays
penetrated into the old veranda and shone on Roman&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>His mother handed him the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I will sing you
something with my cither. I will sing of our grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, beneath his fingers, the strings began to murmur as though
awaking from sleep. Roman bent forward and began, the old people sat
motionless round him.</p>
<p>Sad tones vibrated through the quiet of the old house, notes soft
and sorrowful like some remote mournful cry, notes deep with the tremor
of affliction; the melody rose sobbing through the clear sunset like
the flight of some bird of passage.</p>
<p>In the souls of the old people there rose like a storm the clamour
of past sorrows. The song lamented the ruin of fair lands; they seemed
to listen, as in a sad dream, to the bitter tears of those dying for
their native land. They seemed to see Kosciusko, worn with the
struggle, covered in blood, kneeling with a sword in hand.</p>
<p>Finis Poloni&aelig;! Poland is no more! Ruin everywhere, death all
around; a cry of sorrow rose; the children were torn from their unhappy
land to pine away and die on alien soil!</p>
<p>The chords surged, full of grief, through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>clear sunset. Then slowly, slowly, the melody
died away as though tired with sorrow until the final chord finished
softly, like a distant tremor, ending in deathlike silence.</p>
<p>The listeners seemed turned to stone. Roman leant his head upon his
hand, and his eyes, full of pain, turned towards the flaming sunset.
His chin trembled; his mind was full of bitter memories. The old men
sat as though stunned, like some wounded creatures, their heads upon
their breasts; the old mother cried softly, sighing, her eyes upon her
Roman. As the young man turned his eyes towards the door he saw two
bright tears in Magdalena&rsquo;s blue eyes; amid a deep silence his
own eyes gazed into the girl&rsquo;s while the last crimson rays faded
away from the woods. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"

<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. Al.
Bratescu-Voineshti</span></p>
<p>One springtime a quail nearly dead with fatigue&mdash;she came from
far-away Africa&mdash;dropped from her flight into a green corn-field
on the edge of a plantation. After a few days of rest she began to
collect twigs, dried leaves, straw, and bits of hay, and made herself a
nest on a mound of earth, high up, so that the rain would not spoil it;
then for seven days in succession she laid an egg, in all seven eggs,
as small as sugar eggs, and she began to sit upon them.</p>
<p>Have you seen how a hen sits on her eggs? Well, that is how the
quail did, but instead of sitting in a coop, she sat out of doors,
among the grain; it rained, it pelted with rain, but she never moved,
and not a drop reached the eggs. After three weeks there hatched out
some sweet little birds, not naked like the young of a sparrow, but
covered with yellow fluff, like chickens, only smaller, like seven
little balls of silk, and they began to scramble through the corn,
looking for food. Sometimes the quail caught an ant, sometimes a
grasshopper, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>which she broke into pieces for them, and with
their little beaks they went pic! pic! pic! and ate it up
immediately.</p>
<p>They were pretty and prudent and obedient; they walked about near
their mother, and when she called to them &ldquo;pitpalac!&rdquo; they
ran quickly back to her. Once, in the month of June, when the peasants
came to reap the corn, the eldest of the chicks did not run quickly at
his mother&rsquo;s call, and, alas, a boy caught him under his cap. He
alone could tell the overwhelming fear he felt when he found himself
clasped in the boy&rsquo;s hand; his heart beat like the watch in my
pocket. Luckily for him an old peasant begged him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go, Marin, it&rsquo;s a pity on him, he will die.
Don&rsquo;t you see he can hardly move, he is quite dazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he found himself free, he fled full of fear to the quail to
tell her what had befallen him. She drew him to her and comforted him,
and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what will happen if you do not listen to me? When
you are big you can do what you like, but while you are little you must
follow my words or something worse may overtake you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus they lived, contented and happy. The cutting of the corn
and the stacking of the sheaves shook a mass of seeds on to the stubble
which gave them food, and, although there was no water near, they did
not suffer from thirst because in the early <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>morning they drank the dew-drops on the blades
of grass. By day, when it was very hot, they stayed in the shade of the
plantation; in the afternoon, when the heat grew less, they all went
out on to the stubble, but on the cold nights they would gather in a
group under the protecting wings of the quail as under a tent.
Gradually the fluff upon them had changed into down and feathers, and
with their mother&rsquo;s help they began to fly. The flying lesson
took place in the early morning towards sunrise, when night was turning
into day, and in the evening in the twilight, for during the daytime
there was danger from the hawks which hovered above the
stubble-field.</p>
<p>Their mother sat upon the edge and asked them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when she said &ldquo;three,&rdquo; whrrr! away they all flew
from the side of the plantation, as far as the sentry-box on the high
road, and back again. And their mother told them they were learning to
fly in preparation for a long journey they would have to take when the
summer was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to fly high up above the earth for days and
nights, and we shall see below us great towns and rivers and the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon towards the end of August, while the chicks were
playing happily near their mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>in the stubble, a carriage
was heard approaching, and it stopped in the track by the edge of the
plantation. They all raised their heads with eyes like black beads and
listened. A voice could be heard calling: &ldquo;Nero! to
heel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chicks did not understand, but their mother knew it was a man
out shooting, and she stood petrified with fear. The plantation was
their refuge, but exactly from that direction came the sportsman. After
a moment&rsquo;s thought she ordered them to crouch down close to the
earth, and on no consideration to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must rise, you must stay motionless, he who flies is lost.
Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chicks blinked their eyes to show they understood, and remained
waiting in silence. They could hear the rustling of a dog moving
through the stubble, and from time to time could be heard a man&rsquo;s
voice: &ldquo;Where are you? To heel, Nero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rustling drew near&mdash;the dog saw them; he remained
stationary, one paw in the air, his eyes fixed upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not move,&rdquo; whispered the quail to them, and she ran
quickly farther away from them.</p>
<p>The dog followed slowly after her. The sportsman hurried up. His
foot was so near to them that they could see an ant crawling up the leg
of his boot. Oh, how their hearts beat! A few seconds later the quail
rose, and flew low along the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>ground a few inches in front of
the dog&rsquo;s muzzle. It pursued her, and the sportsman followed,
shouting: &ldquo;To heel! to heel!&rdquo; He could not shoot for fear
of hurting the dog; the quail pretended to be wounded so well that the
dog was determined to catch her at all cost, but when she thought she
was out of range of the gun she quickly flew for shelter towards the
plantation.</p>
<p>During this time, the eldest fledgeling, instead of remaining
motionless like his brothers, as their mother bade them, had taken to
his wings; the sportsman heard the sound of his flight, turned and
shot. He was some distance away. Only a single shot reached his wings.
He did not fall, he managed to fly as far as the plantation, but there
the movement of the wings caused the bone which had only been cracked
at first to give way altogether, and the fledgeling fell with a broken
wing.</p>
<p>The sportsman, knowing the plantation was very thick, and seeing it
was a question of a young bird only, decided it was not worth while to
look for it among the trees. The other little birds did not move from
the spot where the quail had left them.</p>
<p>They listened in silence. From time to time they heard the report of
a gun and the voice of the sportsman calling: &ldquo;Bring it
here!&rdquo; After a time the carriage left the cart-track by the
plantation and followed the sportsman; gradually the shots and the
shouting became fainter and died away, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>in
the silence of the evening nothing could be heard but the song of the
crickets; but when night had fallen and the moon had risen above
Cornatzel, they clearly heard their mother&rsquo;s voice calling to
them from the end of the stubble: &ldquo;Pitpalac! pitpalac!&rdquo;
They flew quickly towards her and found her. She counted them; one was
missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the eldest one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know&mdash;he flew off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the heart-broken quail began to call loudly, and yet more
loudly, listening on every side. A faint voice from the plantation
answered: &ldquo;Piu! piu!&rdquo; When she found him, when she saw the
broken wing, she knew his fate was sealed, but she hid her own grief in
order not to discourage him.</p>
<p>From now on, sad days began for the poor fledgeling. He could
scarcely move with his wing trailing behind him; with tearful eyes he
watched his brothers learning to fly in the early morning and in the
evening; at night when the others were asleep under his mother&rsquo;s
wings, he would ask her anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I shall get well, I shall be able to go with you,
shan&rsquo;t I? And you will show me, too, the big cities and rivers
and the sea, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the quail, forcing herself not to
cry.</p>
<p>In this way the summer passed. Peasants came with ploughs to plough
up the stubble, the quail and her children removed to a neighbouring
field of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>maize; after a time men came to gather in the
maize. They cut the straw and hoed up the ground, then the quails
retired to the rough grass by the edge of the plantation.</p>
<p>The long, beautiful days gave place to short and gloomy ones, the
weather began to grow foggy and the leaves of the plantation withered.
In the evening, belated swallows could be seen flying low along the
ground, sometimes other flocks of birds of passage passed and, in the
stillness of the frosty nights, the cry of the cranes could be heard,
all migrating in the same direction, towards the south.</p>
<p>A bitter struggle took place in the heart of the poor quail. She
would fain have torn herself in two, that one half might go with her
strong children who began to suffer from the cold as the autumn
advanced, and the other half remain with the injured chick which clung
to her so desperately. One day, without any warning, the north-east
wind blew a dangerous blast, and that decided her. Better that one of
the fledgelings should die than that all of them should&mdash;and
without looking back lest her resolution should weaken, she soared away
with the strong little birds, while the wounded one called
piteously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not desert me! Do not desert me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to rise after them, but could not, and remained on the same
spot following them with his eyes until they were lost to sight on the
southern horizon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>Three days later, the whole region was clothed in winter&rsquo;s
white, cold garb. The violent snowstorm was followed by a calm as clear
as crystal, accompanied by a severe frost.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>On the edge of the plantation lay a young quail with a broken wing
and stiff with cold. After a period of great suffering he had fallen
into a pleasant state of semi-consciousness. Through his mind flashed
fragments of things seen&mdash;the stubble-field, the leg of a boot
with an ant crawling upon it, his mother&rsquo;s warm wings. He turned
over from one side to the other and lay dead with his little claws
pressed together as though in an act of devotion. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. Slavici</span></p>
<p>God have mercy on the soul of Schoolmaster Pintilie! He was a good
man, and a well-known chorister. He was very fond of salad with
vinegar. Whenever he was hoarse, he would drink the yolk of an egg with
it; when he raised his voice, the windows rattled while he sang,
&ldquo;Oh, Lord, preserve Thy people.&rdquo; He was schoolmaster in
Butucani, a fine, large town containing men of position and sound
sense, and given to almsgiving and hospitality. Now Schoolmaster
Pintilie had only two children: a daughter married to Petrea Tzapu, and
Trandafir, Father Trandafir, priest in Saraceni.</p>
<p>God keep Father Trandafir! He was a good man, he had studied many
books, and he sang even better than his dead father, God have mercy on
his soul! He always spoke correctly and carefully as though he were
reading out of a book. Father Trandafir was an industrious, careful
man. He gathered from many sources, and made something out of nothing.
He saved, he mended, he collected to get enough for himself and for
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>Father Trandafir went through a great deal in his youth. One does
not achieve big results in a minute or two. The poor man has to go
without a great deal more than he ever gets. He worked harder with his
brain than with a spade and fork. But what he did was not work thrown
away. Young Trandafir became priest in his native town, in Butucani, a
fine large town containing men of position and good sense, but
Trandafir did not enjoy the almsgiving and hospitality.</p>
<p>Father Trandafir would have been a wonderful man had not one thing
spoilt him. He was too severe in his speech, too harsh in his
judgments; he was too straightforward and outspoken. He never minded
his words, but said right out what he had in his mind. It is not good
to be a man like that. Men take offence if you speak too plainly to
them, and it is best to live peaceably with the world. This was evident
in Father Trandafir&rsquo;s case. A man like him could not stay two
years in Butucani. It was first one thing, then another; at one time he
complained to the townspeople, the next time to the archdeacon. Now it
is well known that priests must not make complaints to the archdeacon.
The archdeacon understands presents much better than complaints. But
that was what Father Trandafir would not comprehend.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Father Trandafir was in the right.</p>
<p>But the thing is, right is the prerogative of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>mighty. The weak can only assert themselves
gradually. The ant cannot overthrow the mountain. It can, though,
change its position; but slowly, slowly, bit by bit. Perhaps the Father
knew that this was so in the world; he had his own standard,
though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the devil cannot turn what is true and right into a
lie!&rdquo; This was his remark, and with this remark he got himself
turned out of Butucani. That is to say, it was not only he who did it,
it was the townspeople too. One word and a little something besides to
promote a good understanding with the archdeacon, a visit to the
bishop, and a word there from the archdeacon: things get done if one
knows how to do them. The long and the short of it was that Father
Trandafir was sent from Butucani to Saraceni&mdash;to promote a good
understanding among the faithful. Priest in Saraceni! Who knows what
that means to be priest in Saraceni? That is what befell Father
Trandafir! Who would fain leap the ditch throws his bag over it first.
Father Trandafir only had a wife and two children; his bag was empty.
That was why he leaped so unwillingly from Butucani to Saraceni.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Dry Valley&rdquo; there was a village which they
called &ldquo;Saraceni.&rdquo; A village called &ldquo;poor&rdquo; in a
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; valley; could any place have a more unpleasant
name?</p>
<p>The Dry Valley!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valley&rdquo; because the place was shut in between
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>mountains; &ldquo;dry,&rdquo; because the
stream, which had cut its way through the middle of the valley, was dry
most of the year.</p>
<p>This was how the valley lies.</p>
<p>To the right stood a hill called &ldquo;R&icirc;poasa.&rdquo; On the
left were three other hills, called &ldquo;Fatza,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Grofnitza,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alunish.&rdquo; R&icirc;poasa was
rocky. Fatza was cultivated; the village stood on Grofnitza, while on
Alunish lay the village graveyard among hazel and birch trees. Thus it
lay to right and left, but the chief feature of the landscape stood at
the bottom. Here rose the mountains&mdash;from there, came what did
come.</p>
<p>The other side, beyond R&icirc;poasa was the Rapitza Valley&mdash;a
much deeper valley than the Dry Valley, and so called because the
Rapitza flowed through it. The Rapitza was a treacherous river,
especially in the spring, and the stream in the Dry Valley was a branch
of the Rapitza. In the spring, when the snow melted on the mountains,
the Rapitza got angry and poured part of her fury into the branch that
flowed through the Dry Valley, and the latter ceased to be
&ldquo;dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few hours the inhabitants of Saraceni were rather too rich in
water. This occurred nearly every year. When the crops in the valley
appeared to be most favourable, the Dry Valley belied its name and
washed away all that lay in its path.</p>
<p>It would have been rather better if this invasion had lasted only a
short time, but the water remained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>in the valley, and in many
places formed refuges for the frog family. And instead of corn, osiers
and interlacing willows grew by the side of its pools.</p>
<p>Was it any wonder that in consequence of this the people of Saraceni
had become in time the most idle of men? He is a fool who sows where he
cannot reap, or where he does not know whether he will be able to reap
or not. The Fatza was a sandy spot; the corn grew a few inches high and
the maize a yard; on R&icirc;poasa one could not grow blackberries
even, for at the bottom the water spoilt the fruit. Where there is no
hope of reward there is no incentive to work. Whoever works wants to
earn, but the people of Saraceni had given up all thoughts of gain, and
therefore no one felt inspired to work. Those who could afford it
passed their time lying out of doors; those who could not, spent their
day working in the neighbouring villages. When the winter came life was
hard and bitter.</p>
<p>But whoever has got used to the bad does not think of better things;
the people of Saraceni appeared to think that things could not be
better than they were. Fish in the water, birds in the air, moles in
the ground, and the people of Saraceni in poverty!</p>
<p>Saraceni? One can imagine what a village like Saraceni must have
been; here a house, there a house&mdash;all alike. Hedges were
superfluous, seeing there was nothing to enclose; the street was the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>whole village. It would have been absurd to put
a chimney on the house&mdash;the smoke found its way out through the
roof. There would have been no sense in putting plaster on the walls
either, as that dropped off in time. Some of the buildings were made of
bits of wood knocked together, a roof of straw mixed with hay, an oven
of clay, an old-fashioned veranda outside, a bed with four posts built
into the ground, a door made out of three boards held together by two
stakes placed crosswise&mdash;quickly made and well made&mdash;whoever
was not pleased with it, let him make something he liked better.</p>
<p>At the top of the village, that is to say on the highest point, was
a sort of building which the Saracenese called the
&ldquo;church.&rdquo; It was a heap of old tree trunks piled one on the
top of the other in the form of walls. In the old days&mdash;when, one
does not know&mdash;these kind of walls were open to the sky; later,
one does not know when, the walls had been made to converge in one
place, to support what was supposed to do duty for a tower.
This&mdash;owing to the fact that the supports of the facade had
perished through the buffeting of a very strong wind&mdash;had fallen
towards the patient earth, dragging the entire structure after it. And
there it had remained ever since, for the church counted for little in
Saraceni; it was superfluous.</p>
<p>Priest? They say there is no village without a priest. Probably
whoever said this did not know <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>about Saraceni. Saraceni was
a village without a priest. That is to say, it was a village with a
priest&mdash;only this priest was a priest without a village. Saraceni
was unique in one way. There had never been a priest who stayed more
than three days in Saraceni; he came one day, stayed the next, and left
on the third. Many guilty priests passed through Saraceni; whoever had
stayed there long would have expiated all his sins.</p>
<p>Then Father Trandafir reached this penitential spot. He could not
expect to do as the others had done, come one day, stay the next, and
depart the third. He was too much out of favour with the archdeacon to
imagine that he would send him to another village. He could not remain
without a village: a priest without a village&mdash;a cart without a
wheel, a yoke without oxen, a hat on the top of a wig. He began to
think what he must do; he must take things as they were, and stay
gladly in Saraceni. It was only a village in name, but no one could say
he was a priest without a village. But really a more suitable priest
for a more suitable village you could not have found. The poverty of
the priest corresponded to the poverty in the homes of his
parishioners. From the beginning Trandafir realized one thing: it was
much nicer in Butucani than in Saraceni. There the people all had
something, and you could always have some of it. In Saraceni all the
latches were made of wood. Then the Father reflected: the priest did
all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>business of the town, but the town took care of
the priest&rsquo;s purse. Before long the Father began to feel sure
that the people who started by being charitable and hospitable were not
born fools. &ldquo;It is a wise thing when men meet together to comfort
and cheer each other. Even our Redeemer began with almsgiving, and the
wedding at Cana of Galilee.&rdquo; Thus thought Father Trandafir; but
in Saraceni there was neither almsgiving nor hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said the Father to himself a
little later on, &ldquo;in a poor village there is no corn for the
priest to gather. As long as the people of Saraceni are lazy, so long
shall I be hungry!&rdquo; And he began to think how he was going to
make his parishioners industrious. The industrious man eats the stones,
makes soup out of the stagnant water, and reaps corn where the hemlock
used to grow. &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;concluded the
priest&mdash;&ldquo;when the cow has fodder she is no longer
dry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and he set to work to put it in practice. A man who
has nothing to eat busies himself with other people&rsquo;s affairs. He
does no good that way! The blind man cannot aid the cripple; the hungry
don&rsquo;t improve their village; when the geese keep watch among the
vegetables, little remains for the gardener: but Father Trandafir was
obstinate; when he started, he went on&mdash;and he got there, or he
died by the way.</p>
<p>The first Sunday Father Trandafir preached before the people, who
had assembled in considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"
href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>numbers to see the new
priest. There is nothing more agreeable to a man who desires the
welfare of others than to see his words making an impression. A good
thought multiplies itself, penetrating many hearts, and whoever
possesses it and passes it on, if he values it, rejoices to see it
gaining ground in the world. Father Trandafir felt happy that day.
Never before had he been listened to with such attention as on this
occasion. It seemed as though these people were listening to something
which they knew but which they did not understand well. They drank in
his words with such eagerness, it was as though they wanted to read his
very soul the better to understand his teaching. That day he read the
gospel of &ldquo;The Prodigal Son.&rdquo; Father Trandafir showed how
God, in His unending love for man, had created him to be happy. Having
placed man in the world, God wishes him to enjoy all the innocent
pleasures of life, for only so will he learn to love life and live
charitably with his neighbours. The man who, through his own fault or
owing to other causes, only feels the bitterness and sorrow of this
world cannot love life; and, not loving it, he despises in a sinful
manner the great gift of God.</p>
<p>What kind of people are the lazy people, the people who make no
effort, who do not stretch out a hand to take this gift? They are
sinners! They have no desires&mdash;only carnal appetites. Man has been
given pure desires which he may gratify with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the
fruit of his labours; longings are put into his heart that he may
conquer the world while God Himself contemplates him with pleasure from
on high. To work is the first duty of man; and he who does not work is
a sinner.</p>
<p>After this, the Father sketched in words which seemed to give life
to his ideas the miserable existence of a man perishing from hunger,
and he gave his faithful hearers the thoughts which had germinated in
his own intelligent brain&mdash;how they must work in the spring and in
the summer, in the autumn and in the winter.</p>
<p>The people had listened; the Father&rsquo;s words were written on
their faces; going home they could only talk of what they had heard in
church, and each one felt himself more of a man than before.</p>
<p>Maybe there were many among them who only waited for Sunday to pass
that they might begin their first day of work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has never been such a priest in Saraceni!&rdquo; said
Marcu Flori Cucu, as he parted from his neighbour, Mitru.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A priest that does honour to a village,&rdquo; replied Mitru,
as if he felt that his village was not exactly honoured.</p>
<p>Other Sundays followed. Father Trandafir was ready with his sermon.
The second Sunday he had no one to address. The weather was wet, and
people stayed at home. Other Sundays the weather was fine; probably
then the people did not remember <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>in time; they were loath to
part from God&rsquo;s blue sky. And so the Father only had in church
some old woman or some aged man with failing sight and deaf ears.
Sometimes there was only Cozonac, the bell-ringer. In this way he made
no progress. Had he been a different kind of man he would have stopped
here.</p>
<p>But Father Trandafir was like the goat among cabbages in the garden.
When you turn it out at the door, it comes in through the fence, when
you mend the fence, it jumps over it, and does a lot more damage by
destroying the top of the hedge.</p>
<p>God keep him! Father Trandafir still remained a good man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you will not come to me, I
will go to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the priest went from door to door. He never ceased talking from
the moment it was light. Whenever he came across anyone he gave him
good advice. You met the priest in the fields; you found him on the
hill; if you went down the valley you encountered the priest; the
priest was in the woods. The priest was in church; the priest was at
the death-bed; the priest was at the wedding; the priest was with your
next-door neighbour&mdash;you had to fly the village if you wanted to
escape the priest. And whenever he met you, he gave you wise
counsel.</p>
<p>During a whole year, Father Trandafir gave good advice. People
listened gladly&mdash;they liked to stay and talk to the priest even if
he did give them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"
name="pb186">186</a>]</span>good advice. All the same, the old saying
holds good: men know what they ought to do, but they don&rsquo;t do it.
The Father was disappointed. After a certain time he ceased to give
advice. There was not a man in the village upon whom he had not poured
the whole weight of his learning: he had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; said the priest once more.
&ldquo;Advice does not pay. I must start something more
severe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to chaff.</p>
<p>Wherever he found a man, Father Trandafir began to make him
ridiculous, to make fun of him in every kind of way. If he passed a
house that had not been re-roofed yesterday, he would say to the owner:
&ldquo;Oh, you are a clever man, you are! You have windows in the roof.
You do love the light and the blessed sun!&rdquo; If he found a woman
in a dirty blouse: &ldquo;Look at me! Since when have you taken to
wearing stuff dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he met an unwashed child: &ldquo;Listen, good wife, you must have
a lot of plum jam if you can plaster your children with it!&rdquo; And
if he came across a man lying in the shade he would say to him,
&ldquo;Good luck with your work! Good luck with your work!&rdquo; If
the man got up, he would beg him not to stop work, for his
children&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>He began like this, but he carried it altogether too far. It got to
such a pitch that the people did their utmost to get out of the
priest&rsquo;s way. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>became a perfect pest. The worst
thing about it was that the people nicknamed him &ldquo;Popa
Tanda&rdquo; because he chaffed them so. And &ldquo;Popa Tanda&rdquo;
he has remained ever since.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, it was only in one way the people did not like
the priest. Each one was ready to laugh at the others with the priest;
no one was pleased, though, when the others laughed at him. That is
human; every one is ready to saddle his neighbour&rsquo;s mare. In that
way, Father Trandafir pleased his parishioners, but he was not content
himself. Before the year was out, every man in the village had become a
tease; there was not a person left of whom to make fun, and in the end
the wags began to laugh at themselves. That put an end to it. Only one
thing remained to do: the village to make fun of the priest.</p>
<p>Two whole years passed without Trandafir being able to stir up the
people, even when he had passed from advising them to annoying them.
They became either givers of advice or they were teasers: all day they
stood in groups, some of them giving advice, others joking. It was a
wonderful affair; the people recognized the right, despised the bad;
but nothing altered them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! say now, didn&rsquo;t Father Trandafir mind? Didn&rsquo;t
he get angry, very angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did get wild. He began to abuse the people. As he had proceeded
to advise them, and to chaff them, so now he proceeded to abuse them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>Whenever he got hold of a man, he abused him.
But he did not get far with this. At first the people allowed
themselves to be insulted. Later on, they began to answer back, on the
sly, as it were. Finally, thinking it was going too far, they began to
abuse the priest.</p>
<p>From now on, things got a little involved. Everything went
criss-cross. The people began to tell the priest that if he did not
leave off laughing at them, and insulting them, they would go to the
bishop and get him removed from the village. That is what the priest
deserved. The people had hit on the very thing! Throw him out of
Saraceni! The priest began to curse in earnest. Off he went; the people
got in to their carts to go to the archdeacon, and from the archdeacon
to the bishop.</p>
<p>In the Book of Wisdom, concerning the life of this world, there is a
short sentence which says: our well-wishers are often our undoing and
our evil-wishers are useful to us. Father Trandafir was not lucky in
getting good out of his evil-wishers. The bishop was a good soul,
worthy of being put in all the calendars all over the face of the
earth. He took pity on the poor priest, said he was in the right, and
scolded the people.</p>
<p>And so Popa Tanda stayed in Saraceni.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Misfortunes generally heap themselves upon mankind. One gives rise
to another, or are they, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>perhaps, inseparable? Anyhow, they
are always like light and shade, one alongside the other.</p>
<p>By now Father Trandafir had three children. When he returned from
the bishop, he found his wife in bed. There was a fourth little
blessing in the house. A sick wife, three little children, a fourth at
the breast, and a tumble-down house; the snow drifted through the
walls, the stove smoked, the wind came through the roof, the granary
was bare, his purse empty, and his heart heavy.</p>
<p>Father Trandafir was not the man to find a way out of this
embarrassing state of things. Had it been some one else in his
situation, he could have helped him: he could not comfort himself. For
a long time he stood in the dim light of the little lamp; every one
around him slept. The sick woman was asleep. Now there is nothing more
conducive to melancholy than the sight of people asleep. He loved those
sleeping forms; he loved them and was responsible for their happiness;
he lived for them, and their love made life precious to him. Thoughts
crowded into his brain. His mind turned to the past and to the future;
considering the state in which he found himself, the future could only
appear depicted in the saddest colours. His children! His wife! What
would become of them? His heart was heavy, and he could not find one
consoling thought, one single loop-hole of escape; nowhere in the world
was there anything to give him a gleam of hope. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. The Father went to church with bowed head,
to read Matins.</p>
<p>Like the generality of mankind, Father Trandafir had never given
much thought to what he was doing. He was a priest, and he was content
with his lot. He liked to sing, to read the Gospel, to instruct the
faithful, to comfort, and to give spiritual assistance to the erring.
His thoughts did not go much beyond that. Had he been asked at any time
whether he realized the sanctity, the inner meaning of his calling,
maybe he would have laughed to himself at all those things which a man
only grasps in moments of intense suffering. It is man&rsquo;s nature
when his mind comprehends a series of more or less deep thoughts, to
measure the whole world by this standard, and not to believe what he
does not understand. But man does not always think in this way. There
are events during which his brain becomes inactive: in danger, when no
escape seems possible; in moments of joy, when he knows not from what
source his happiness is derived; at times when his train of thought
seems to have lost all coherence. Then, when man has reached, in any
way, the point where the possible becomes indistinguishable from the
impossible, he ceases to reason, instinct asserts itself.</p>
<p>Father Trandafir went into the church. How many times had he not
entered that church! Just as a blacksmith might enter his forge. But
this time he was seized with an incomprehensible fear, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>took
a few steps forward and then hid his face in his hands and began to sob
bitterly. Why did he cry? Before whom did he cry? His lips uttered
these words only: &ldquo;Almighty God, succour me!&rdquo; Did he
believe that this prayer, expressed with all the energy of despair,
could bring him help? He believed nothing; he thought of nothing; he
was in a state of exaltation.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The Holy Scriptures teach us that just as the ploughman lives on the
fruit of his toil, so does the spiritual pastor, who serves the altar,
live by the result of his service at that altar. Father Trandafir
always believed in the Holy Scriptures; he always worked only for the
spiritual welfare of his people, and expected that they, in return,
would furnish him with his daily bread. But the world is not always in
agreement with what is written and commanded; only the priest agreed
with it, the people did not. The Father got little from his office,
anyhow not enough; this is to say, four pieces of ground near the
village, a poll-tax on the population, and baptismal and burying
fees.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, it amounted to nothing, seeing that the earth
produced scarcely anything, the poll-tax existed only in name, the
new-born were baptized for nothing, and the dead were buried gratis by
the priest.</p>
<p>Near the church was a deserted house; a house in name only. The
owner of the house could have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"
href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>kept cattle, but he had no
beasts. By the side of the house there was room for a garden, but there
was no garden because, as we have already said, there were no fences in
Saraceni. Father Trandafir bought the whole place and lived in it. As
the house belonged to the priest, nothing much was done to put it in
order, and it was quite dilapidated, the walls had holes in them, there
were rents in the roof. The Father only troubled himself about other
people&rsquo;s houses.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s table was no better than the house. According to
the old saying, man follows the ways of other men even when he wants to
make them follow his own: the priest lived like the rest of the
village. Happily he had his wife&rsquo;s dowry, but often one does not
try to get help from just the place where it is to be had. The season
of Lent drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not do!&rdquo; said Father Trandafir. &ldquo;This
will not do!&rdquo; And he began to do as the rest of the world does,
to occupy himself first and foremost with the care of his own
house.</p>
<p>Directly the spring-time came, he hired a gipsy, and set him to work
to plaster the house with clay. In a few days all four walls were
firmly plastered. After that, the priest enjoyed sitting outside more
than inside the house, because you could not see the walls of the house
so well from within; a plastered house was a fine thing in Saraceni,
especially when one could say to oneself, &ldquo;That is mine!&rdquo;
There was one thing, though, which was not as it should <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>be.
Every time the Father&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the sides of the roof he
went indoors&mdash;he felt he had seen enough. He did not want to see
the defective roof, but every time he wanted to look at the walls he
had to see the roof. That damned roof! It could no longer be left like
that.</p>
<p>Down in the valley where there are numerous pools, not only willows
and osiers grew, but here and there were to be found sedges and rushes,
cat&rsquo;s-tail and a species of reed. &ldquo;That is what I will
do!&rdquo; thought the priest. He engaged a man, and sent him out to
cut sedges and rushes and cat&rsquo;s-tail and reeds. One Saturday the
house was surrounded by bundles tied with osiers; and the following
Saturday the roof was mended and edged on the top with bundles of reeds
over which were stretched two strips of wood fastened with cross
pieces. The work was good, and not dear. People passed by the
priest&rsquo;s house nodding their heads and saying, &ldquo;The priest
is one of the devil&rsquo;s own men.&rdquo; Now the priest could stay
happily outside.</p>
<p>But this happiness did not last long. There was still one thing that
was not quite right. The priest felt that he was too much in the open.
There was no other house in the village like his, and it would have
been better a little separated from the village. The Father hardly
liked to say &ldquo;At my place,&rdquo; when &ldquo;my place&rdquo; was
&ldquo;in the village.&rdquo; There must be a fence, and a gate for the
people to enter by, when they came to see the priest; it might
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>be a fence in name only, and the gate only a
hurdle, but it must be an understood thing that before anyone could
enter the priest&rsquo;s house he must cross the priest&rsquo;s yard.
Once more the priest hired a man and sent him to cut briars and stakes.
He fixed the stakes into the ground, and placed the briars between
them, and there was the fence, ready made. In front of the house, in
the direction of the church, about half an acre of ground was enclosed:
the gate was formed by four poles fastened by two others placed
crosswise. The priest&rsquo;s wife especially rejoiced at being thus
shut in, and the priest rejoiced when he saw his wife&rsquo;s pleasure.
There was not a day on which either the priest or his wife did not say
to the children: &ldquo;Listen! you are not to go outside the yard;
play quietly at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once a man starts, he never gets to the end. One desire gives rise
to another. Now the priest&rsquo;s wife got an idea in her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Father,&rdquo; she said one morning, &ldquo;I
think it would be a good plan to make a few beds for vegetables by the
side of the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vegetable-beds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we can sow onions, carrots, haricot beans, potatoes, and
cabbages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Father was astonished. To him that seemed quite beyond their
powers. Vegetable-beds in Saraceni!</p>
<p>For a few days his head was full of vegetable-beds, of potatoes,
cabbages, and haricot beans; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195"
href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>a few days after that, the
ground was already dug up and the beds were ready. Not a day passed on
which the priest and his wife did not go about ten times to the beds to
see if the seeds were growing. Great was the joy one day. The priest
had risen very early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have sprouted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest and his wife and all the children spent the whole day
squatting by the beds. The more seeds they saw appear above the ground,
the happier they were.</p>
<p>And again the villagers passed by the priest&rsquo;s house and
looked through the thorns at the priest&rsquo;s vegetable-beds, and
they said once more, &ldquo;The priest is one of the devil&rsquo;s own
men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, wife,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be a good plan to sow maize along the fence and round the
beds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it would! I like fresh maize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, especially when it&rsquo;s roasted on the
embers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was a new task! The priest surrounded himself with maize. He
laughed with pleasure when he thought how pretty it would be when the
maize grew up all round and shut out the briars on the fence which had
begun to offend his eyes. But there is the old proverb, &ldquo;Much
wants more.&rdquo; At the back of the house was another strip of
ground, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>about four times the size of the bit they had
cultivated. The priest could not get it out of his head. Why should
this land lie fallow? Couldn&rsquo;t he plant maize at the back of the
house too? In the fields opposite, men were ploughing and sowing, the
ground was untouched still in the village because it was the
village.</p>
<p>Marcu Flori Cucu, the priest&rsquo;s neighbour, had a plough; it was
rather dilapidated, but it was a plough, and Mitru Catamush,
Marcu&rsquo;s neighbour, had two feeble oxen and a foundered horse. The
priest, Marcu, Mitru, the oxen and the horse, worked all one day from
morn till eve. The ground was ploughed up and sown with maize. From
thenceforward, the priest was happier when he was at the back of the
house.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful and beautiful bit of work&mdash;what furrows! And
here and there among the furrows a blade of maize peeped out. In spite
of this, the priest scratched himself once or twice, and then fairly
often, behind the ear. It seemed as though something still weighed upon
his mind. It was a difficult matter, which he hardly dare take in hand:
the glebe lands. Up to now, they had been neglected; at present, he did
not know what to do with them. He would have liked to work them
himself. He would have liked to see his own men sowing them; he would
have liked to take his wife there in the autumn. It was very tempting.
He talked a great deal to his wife <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>about the matter. They would
need horses, a cart, a plough, a labourer, stables&mdash;they would
want a quantity of things. Moreover, the priest did not understand
agriculture.</p>
<p>However, the vegetable-beds were growing green, the maize was
springing up. The priest made up his mind; he took the residue of his
wife&rsquo;s dowry and set to work. Marcu&rsquo;s plough was good
enough to start with. The priest bought one horse from Mitru; a man in
the Rapitza Valley had another one; Stan Schiopu had a cart with three
wheels. The priest bought it as he got a wheel from Mitru, to make up
for the horse being foundered.</p>
<p>Cozonac, the bell-ringer, engaged himself as labourer to the priest,
for his house was only a stone&rsquo;s throw away. The priest drove
four posts into the ground at one end of the house, two long ones and
two short, and he made three sides of plaited osiers and a roof of
rushes, and there was the stable all ready.</p>
<p>During these days, Father Trandafir had aged by about ten years; but
he grew young again when he placed his wife and children in the cart,
whipped up the horses, and drove off to see their ploughed land.</p>
<p>The villagers saw him, and shook their heads, and said once more:
&ldquo;The priest is the devil&rsquo;s own man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s wife had her own feminine worries. She had a
beautiful Icon which had been given to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>her by the son of the
priest at Vezura. At present the Icon was lying at the bottom of a box
wrapped up in paper. For a long time she had wished to place it between
the windows, to put flowers and sweet basil round it, and look at it
often; because this Icon represented the Holy Virgin, and the
priest&rsquo;s daughter was called Mary. But the walls were dirty and
the Icon had no case. There was another thing that annoyed the
priest&rsquo;s wife: one window was filled in with a pig&rsquo;s
bladder, and in the other were three broken panes mended with paper.
The house was rather dark.</p>
<p>Easter drew near. There were only five days to Holy Week. If the
priest wanted to spend Easter with his wife, he had still three
important things to get: whitewash for the walls, windows for the
house, and a case for the Icon of the most Blessed Virgin&mdash;all
objects that could be found only in a town.</p>
<p>To the market, then!</p>
<p>The priest had horses and a cart. He was vexed about the osier
baskets for the maize; only the backs and sides of them still remained.
He was ashamed that a priest like himself should have to go to the
market without any maize-baskets. He could not borrow any, seeing he
was at Saraceni, where even the priest had no proper maize-baskets.</p>
<p>They say &ldquo;Necessity is the best teacher.&rdquo; The Father
sent Cozonac down the valley to fetch osiers, planted two stakes in the
ground with thinner sticks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>set between them about a
hand&rsquo;s breadth apart, and then the priest and his wife and
children, and Cozonac too, began to plait the osiers in. Before long
the baskets were ready. The work was not very remarkable, but for all
that they were the best baskets in Saraceni, and so good that Cozonac
could not refrain from saying, &ldquo;The priest is one of the
devil&rsquo;s own men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the market-place and from the market-place home the Father went
proudly with his baskets; other people had some, but he found people
could buy worse baskets than those he had made himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the priest making?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baskets for the maize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has got some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is making them for those who have not got any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Easter, Cozonac began to clear the pools of osiers which the
priest wove into baskets. The longer the work continued, the better was
it done; the last basket was always the best.</p>
<p>Marcu Flori Cucu was a sensible man. He liked to stay and talk to
the priest. Cozonac cleared the osiers, the priest plaited them, while
Marcu lay upon his stomach with his head in his hands and idly
watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This osier is a little too long,&rdquo; said the priest,
measuring the osier with his eye. &ldquo;Here, Marcu! Give me the
hatchet to make it shorter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hatchet was at Marcu&rsquo;s feet. Marcu raised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>the
upper part of his body, supported himself on his elbows, stretched out
his legs, and began feeling about for the hatchet, trying to draw it up
by his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; said the priest, and gave him a cut with
the osier.</p>
<p>Marcu jumped up and assured the priest that he was much more nimble
than he thought. In the end, this assurance was of great use to him. By
Whitsuntide the priest had a cart-load of baskets ready to take to the
market, and Marcu knew very well that if the priest sold the baskets he
would have a cheerful holiday.</p>
<p>The priest had had help for some weeks, and the help had always
brought a reward to the man who had given it.</p>
<p>Just before Whitsuntide the rain began, and seemed as though it
would never cease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what I shall do,&rdquo; said the priest.
&ldquo;It seems as though I must leave the market until after
Whitsuntide. I do not like going in the rain. If it does not stop
raining by Thursday, I just shall not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcu scratched himself behind his ears and said nothing. He could
see that it did not suit the priest to get soaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said a little later, ceasing to plait,
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t we weave an awning? There are reeds and rushes
and osiers in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; replied the priest.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>&ldquo;It could be made the same way as we are
making these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through helping him, Marcu had learnt to make better baskets than
the priest. The awning did Marcu great credit, the priest did not get
wet and came back from the market with a full purse.</p>
<p>This time Whit-Sunday was fine. The priest&rsquo;s wife had a new
gown, the three eldest children had dolls bought in the town; the tiny
one, Mary, had a straw hat with two pink flowers, the walls were white
both inside and out, the windows were whole, the house was light, and
the Icon of the Holy Virgin could be seen very well placed high up
between the windows, decorated with flowers grown along the edge of the
vegetable-beds. The priest had brought white flour, meat, butter, and
even sugar, from the town. The priest loved his wife, but it was not
his way to kiss her at odd times. But, this morning, the first thing he
did was to embrace her. His wife began to cry&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
why&mdash;when Father Trandafir entered the church he felt inclined to
cry; he had seen people in front of the Icon and there were tears in
his eyes when he went up to the altar. The people say he had never sung
more beautifully than he did that day. The saying remained: &ldquo;To
sing like the priest at Whitsuntide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parishioners went to see the priest; they passed through the
gate before they crossed the door-step; they wiped their boots, put
their hats <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>on their sticks, leaned their sticks against the
wall, smoothed their moustaches and their beards, and stepped inside.
When they came out of the house again, they took a look round, nodded
their heads, and said nothing.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The years come, the years go; the world moves on, and man is
sometimes at peace with the world, and sometimes at odds with it. The
high road passed through the town, passed by the Dry Valley and ran
farther on to the Rapitza Valley. Where the roads met, at the
conjunction of the two valleys, there was a mill on the Rapitza. Near
Rapitza was a cross; close to the cross was a fountain, and by the
fountain were eight fine sycamores. This spot was called &ldquo;The
Cross of Saraceni.&rdquo; From here to Saraceni was only about an hour
by road. In spite of this, whenever he came from the town, the man of
Saraceni pulled up here to water his horse, and waited a while, hoping
that some wayfarer might come and ask: &ldquo;What village is that
where one sees that beautiful church with white walls and the
glittering tower?&rdquo; And when he is asked, he strokes his
moustache, and looking proudly towards the place replies: &ldquo;Up
there on the Grofnitza? That&rsquo;s our village&mdash;Saraceni; but
you ought to hear the bells&mdash;what bells that tower contains! One
can hear them a three hours&rsquo; journey away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where the road divided there stood a sign-post with two arms; on one
arm was written, &ldquo;To the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>Rapitza Valley,&rdquo; and on
the other one, &ldquo;Towards the Dry Valley.&rdquo; There was no road
anywhere round about like the one that ran through the Dry Valley
towards Saraceni.</p>
<p>It was as smooth as a table, and as solid as a cherry-stone. One
could see the Saracenese had constructed it lovingly. To right and
left, at intervals of ten to fifteen paces, were some shady nut-trees
which were a pleasure to look at. The river-bed lay on the right; the
road ran along its bank, but higher up, so that the water could not
disturb it. The Saracenese had to destroy rock in their progress, but
that they did cheerfully, for out of the rock they built the road.</p>
<p>From here on, the Saracene felt at home, and drove at a foot&rsquo;s
pace. But he was not bored for a second. At every step almost he met an
acquaintance with whom he exchanged words, &ldquo;Where do you come
from?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; One man had a cart
full of lime, another a load of apples; then came a man carrying a
trellis-work, and another with a wheelbarrow, a stave, or some other
article made of wood.</p>
<p>From time to time, along the side of the road, one found the
stone-masons at work, their trowels ringing from daybreak till sunset.
This road was not a dreary one!</p>
<p>There were lime-kilns where the road ran along the valley. In one
place there was a whole village. Some men were loading up lime, others
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>unloading stone and wood; the masons were
shaping the stones, the men at the kilns were throwing wood on to the
fires; the foremen were making noise enough for five.</p>
<p>From this point one could see the village well. The gardens were
full of trees; only between the bushes or beyond the trees did one
catch a glimpse here and there of a bit of the walls or the roofs of
the houses. The priest&rsquo;s house was just up by the church; one
could only see five windows and a red roof with two chimney stacks.
Opposite the church stood the school. The house, of which one could
only see a piece of wall with two windows and a roof, belonged to Marcu
Flori Cucu.</p>
<p>The big building visible lower down was the Town Hall. If the houses
had lain less closely together the village would have looked very
beautiful, but, as it was, one only caught a glimpse and must imagine
the rest.</p>
<p>Every one had changed; Father Trandafir only had remained the same:
fresh, gay, and busy. If his grey hair and grizzled beard had not
betrayed his age, we might have thought that the little children with
whom he played in the evening, on the seat in front of the house, were
his own. One of them, whom he had lifted up to kiss, stole his hat from
off his head and ran away with it. Mariuca opened the window and called
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Trandafir, don&rsquo;t leave grandfather
bareheaded.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then she flew from the window to catch Ileana, who had stolen her
grandmother&rsquo;s bonnet and adorned herself with it, and was now
proudly showing herself to her grandfather. The old grandfather laughed
heartily, he loved a joke. From close by came Father Costa, and caught
first Ileana and then Mariuca, kissed them, and then seated himself by
his father-in-law&rsquo;s side. Marcu, neighbour and old friend,
Mariuca&rsquo;s father-in-law, and attached to the house, saw the group
and came to join in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man, take your hat; you must not sit there
bare-headed,&rdquo; said the grandmother, handing his hat through the
window.</p>
<p>One of the villagers, in passing, wished him &ldquo;Good
night,&rdquo; and added to himself, &ldquo;May the Lord preserve him
for many years, for he is one of God&rsquo;s own men.&rdquo;

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By Ion Popovici-Banatzeanu</span></p>
<p>The man tramping along the broad, dusty highway gradually drew near
to a town. He carried a bundle on his back&mdash;some old clothes, a
change of underlinen and a pair of boots&mdash;and at his breast,
wrapped up in a handkerchief, were his certificate of baptism, his
work-book and his book of military service&mdash;all his worldly
goods.</p>
<p>For three years he had served the Emperor, and failing to find
employment in the town where he was, with a stick in his hand and a few
coppers in his pocket he had set out into the world, and walked with
the steadiness of a man well acquainted with the road.</p>
<p>Some one had advised him to go to Lugosh; he had heard there were
many craftsmen there driving a big trade, and he pursued his way with
hope in his heart. He felt strong and eager to work. For three years he
had not seen a workshop, for three years he had not followed the craft
which he had learnt so lovingly; it seemed to him he would hardly know
how to handle a hide now. Yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>with each step forward his
confidence in himself increased, and he thought, &ldquo;I will work,
and work so that every one wonders, and the peasant who takes in his
hand the sandals I have tanned will never want to part with
them.&rdquo; And when he said this to himself he walked faster. He
would have liked to fly that he might arrive quicker. But then again he
slackened his pace, and other thoughts assailed him: supposing he did
not get a situation, what would he do then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing I do not find work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was afraid to answer this or to think of what he would do if he
did not get a place. Ah, just to find work with somebody. He comforted
himself, and putting away from him all sad thoughts he imagined a rosy
future. He saw himself in the workshop doing the work of seven, and
saving penny after penny; he saw himself buying first one skin, then
two, then three, six and more, and many more, until he had a workshop
of his own, and then, if he met a girl he liked, he would marry.</p>
<p>He was intoxicated by his own thoughts, and hardly knew where he was
going. He walked slowly with his head bent. He would not rest, for he
felt no fatigue; it was as though some one urged him forward.</p>
<p>It was late autumn, the fields were bare and the road dreary.
Buffeted by the wind, the poplars along the side of the road were
shedding their leaves, and sadly swaying their pointed tops.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>The country lay barren and dead, while the voiceless hills were
glowing in the light of the setting sun like a man who, on the point of
death, tries to save himself by some final remedy. The outlines of
solitary fountains prolonged themselves mournfully against the horizon,
as though they regretted the life and gaiety of other days. A flight of
crows, frightened by I know not what, rose from the dark marshes and
alighted upon the tops of the poplars, beating their wings and cawing
above the waste.</p>
<p>But Sandu saw and heard nothing; he walked absorbed in himself and
communing with his own heart.</p>
<p>He entered the town as the lights were being lit. He took no side
turnings but kept to the main street so that the dogs should not hinder
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep straight on,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;past the
Roumanian church, then I take the turning to the right till I get to
the bridge and at the bridge I must ask my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the bridge he asked his way, but they explained it in such a
manner that he lost himself, and it was late before he reached the
hostel. He bade good evening and asked rather diffidently whether there
were anywhere he could sleep, and if there were something to eat.</p>
<p>The innkeeper entered into conversation with him, and learnt that
Sandu came from the Dobre <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href=
"#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>district, had done three
years&rsquo; military service, and now was looking for a situation with
some tanner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; Sandu spoke with difficulty, <span class=
"corr" id="xd19e3495" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>to see if I
can find a place here, for you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, perhaps you may,&rdquo; the innkeeper interrupted
him, and went out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you say I shall find a place?&rdquo; Sandu asked the
innkeeper as he brought him some lard and a piece of bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you may find one if you are good at your trade and
hard-working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu said nothing; the only word he could have uttered would have
been to say, as he could have said, how hard he meant to work, and what
kind of a man he was. But as he could not say this to the innkeeper he
told himself what a lot of work he meant to do, and how well he meant
to behave himself, as well as if he were a young girl.</p>
<p>Absorbed in thought, he ate at long intervals, and the innkeeper,
seeing how silent he was, bade him put out the lamp and wished him a
good night.</p>
<p>But the night was not restful. He crossed himself and stretched
himself out on the bench by the side of the wall, his bundle he placed
at his head and carefully pushed his money and his papers underneath
it. Although he was tired from his tramp, sleep would not visit his
eyes. He grew excited, a sort of giddiness overcame him, and he broke
into a cold sweat at his own thoughts. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>tossed and turned on
the narrow bench, and pressed his forehead against the cold wall as he
sighed heavily.</p>
<p>When the day broke he was exhausted, his bones seemed weak, his feet
could hardly support him, and his head felt queer. Water, and the
freshness of the early morning, revived him, and he made his way to the
market-place where, according to the innkeeper, he would find the
booths of the master-tanners.</p>
<p>Although it was autumn, people were in no hurry to buy sandals, and
only a few of the master-tanners, who did business here on Sundays,
were walking about and moving their strips of leather according to the
position of the sun so as to ensure them being in the shade.</p>
<p>Sandu stood still by the cross in the market-place, and it seemed as
if a knife went through his heart; when he saw the empty booths he felt
as though his last atom of will had been destroyed. He felt as though
he must turn back, as though he could not ask. It seemed to him as
though he had not the strength to bear hearing one of the tanners tell
him he had no place for him; it would be such a catastrophe that he
would sink into the earth.</p>
<p>Not knowing what he did he moved forward; but when he approached the
first booth he lost confidence, and had not the courage to greet the
master.</p>
<p>He passed on. He walked round the booths <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>two
or three times, but could not summon up courage to ask whether one of
the tanners had a situation open or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will go,&rdquo; he said very firmly to himself, to give
himself strength, but when he moved he saw a peasant go up to the
booth. &ldquo;I will let him make his purchase and then I will
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not stir, he was afraid, especially when the master, not
being able to come to terms with the peasant, undid the box, and flung
the sandals violently into it. He did nothing; it seemed terrible to
him to have to go up to the booth. He did not know why. He felt angry
with himself that it should be so. And as he asked himself why he was
like this, he recalled to mind various acquaintances who were so very
bold and fearless. If only he could be like that! But he could not be
so, his nature did not allow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you good-for-nothing, you are wandering about here like a
sheep in a pen,&rdquo; a tanner, small of stature, with brown eyes and
a harsh voice, said roughly to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; stammered Sandu. &ldquo;I am not a
good-for-nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Then why do you keep coming round? Haven&rsquo;t I seen
you? You walk a bit, you stand still, you have been round us several
times, and now you are standing still again; it is as though you had
some evil intention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I am not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, whatever you are or are not, else you will see I will get
rid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu could hardly stand, a sort of mist darkened his eyes, and his
heart was bursting. He would have cried, but he was ashamed for a grown
man to be walking across the market-place with tears in his eyes. He
suffered and would gladly have told how deeply the words he had
listened to had hurt him, but he had no one to whom he could open his
heart.</p>
<p>He returned to the innkeeper with whom he was lodging. Tired and
spent he threw himself on the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the innkeeper.</p>
<p>Sandu looked vaguely at him, then, as if afraid to hear the sound of
his own voice, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The innkeeper felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found a situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not ask for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can you hope to get one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu remained silent. The innkeeper looked strangely at him,
shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, and went to attend to his
duties.</p>
<p>With his elbows on the table, and his head resting in his hands,
Sandu gazed in front of him, and who knows where his thoughts would
have led him if the innkeeper had not said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Dinu Talpoane sent to ask whether there was any
workman in need of work. Go with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>the apprentice and he may
perhaps engage you. He is a respectable man and does a big
trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Sandu got up. It seemed to him he must be dreaming.
But when he saw the apprentice with an apron stained yellow and with
big boots covered with stale sap, his eyes shone, and he could have
kissed the innkeeper&rsquo;s hands for very joy.</p>
<p>Outside he began to talk to the apprentice, who told him that the
master was a splendid man, but his wife was harsh and heaven defend you
from her tongue; that the workshop was large and the work considerable,
especially in the autumn; and that the master sometimes engaged workmen
by the day in order to get a set of hides ready more quickly; and many
other things he told him. But Sandu was no longer listening.</p>
<p>When the apprentice saw that he asked no further questions, he
hesitated to say more, and they walked along together in silence.</p>
<p>Sandu knew where he had to go, but he did not know what to say, or
what terms to make&mdash;by the year, the month, the week; he could not
think what would be best to do. What he knew of the workshop of the
master-tanner with whom he had learnt his trade, and all he had heard
from the hands working there with him, seemed to be buzzing in his
brain until he grew so bewildered that he could not have told how many
days there are in a week, or how much money he would earn if he worked
for a whole month. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said the apprentice, stopping in front of
a doorway with gates.</p>
<p>Sandu felt a cold shiver go through him. For a second he stood
still. Three years as apprentice and four years as workman he had
worked for one master only, and he would have remained there all his
life if he had not been taken to be a soldier, and if the master had
not died he would have gone back to him the day he left the army. He
felt quite nervous, and if the apprentice had not opened the gate he
would not have gone in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are eating,&rdquo; said the apprentice, seeing the big
yard was empty, and he crossed to the bottom of it where a small house
stood built against the old workshop.</p>
<p>They were close to the window when they heard people talking in the
house, and the clatter of knives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Sandu, &ldquo;you go on and say I have
come but that I am waiting till they have finished dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apprentice went in and told the master that a workman was
outside, but would not come in till the master had got up from the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his wife interrupted him with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him out there. Who knows what sort of a creature he is
if he does not venture to show his face inside! Let me have my dinner
in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband, a well-built man, with a round, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>red
face and kind blue eyes, felt if he said any more his wife would snap
his head off, so he let the apprentice go.</p>
<p>The apprentice, who knew that one word from the mistress was worth a
hundred orders from the master, withdrew to the hearth in the outer
room, and waited till he should be called to dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter, Ghitza, you are not
eating?&rdquo; he heard his mistress saying. &ldquo;Or are you waiting
to be invited? Dear, dear, perhaps I ought to beg the gentleman to come
to table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apprentice, accustomed to the mistress&rsquo;s ways, took a
chair. But he had not swallowed three mouthfuls before the mistress
bade him call in &ldquo;that ne&rsquo;er-do-well out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu shyly wished them good day, but of all those sitting round the
table he only saw the master, and by his side the mistress, whose eyes
seemed to scorch him and make him lose his presence of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; the master asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Sandu Boldurean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a low voice he told where he was born, with whom he had
learnt the trade, and how long he had worked, but during the
questioning he scarcely raised his eyelids. He grew confused at once
when the mistress screamed at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll ruin your hat turning it round like that in
your hands. Put it down somewhere and speak up so that a man can
understand what you are saying.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sandu felt the blood go to his head, and hardly knowing what he was
doing he hung his hat on a bolt on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you worked only with one master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one. See, here is my work-book,&rdquo; and with some
haste he drew out the handkerchief, unknotted it, and held out his
&ldquo;work-book&rdquo; to the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see too,&rdquo; said the mistress, snatching the book
from her husband&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s no wonder
this idiot stayed in the same place; and who knows what kind of a
master it was?&rdquo; she whispered to her husband.</p>
<p>He would have replied that it was a very good thing for a workman to
have stayed so long with one master, for most tanners worked in the
same way, and only here and there were the hides dressed differently;
but he was ashamed to say so before the workman, and so he busied
himself by looking through the book.</p>
<p>Sandu broke into a sweat; when he held out the book he felt his soul
was full of joy at having got so far, but little by little, especially
when the mistress took the book and whispered to her husband, his heart
seemed turned to ice.</p>
<p>What would he say to him? Supposing he found something bad?
Supposing he did not give him work? These were the questions which
passed through his mind and which he could not answer, although he knew
his book only spoke well of him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"
href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>and that the master required
a workman because it was autumn when business is in full swing.</p>
<p>A great burden seemed lifted from him at the master&rsquo;s
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, I will engage you. How much did you get from your late
master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked for him for four years and had a salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of talk! We will give you one and a half florins
per week without washing, and you can stay, though probably in the army
you have forgotten all you knew about work,&rdquo; the mistress broke
into the conversation, as she rose from the table.</p>
<p>It was the signal for the two workmen and the apprentice to return
to their work.</p>
<p>Sandu stood transfixed. Only the master and a child of six or seven
years of age remained in the house, as the girl and the mistress went
into the passage to see to the dinner things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you agree? Will you stay or not?&rdquo; scolded the
mistress as she appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stay,&rdquo; replied Sandu, scarcely knowing what he
said.</p>
<p>The master looked at her, and turned to Sandu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had your dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come for you to feed him,&rdquo; his wife interrupted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mistress threw him a look full of meaning, and disappeared into
the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can start work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu turned and went out after the master; they walked side by
side. When they reached the yard gate they stopped. The master would
have liked to say something about the pay. One and a half florins a
week seemed so very little to him, but Sandu was simple and glad to get
work, and he did not ask for much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, I will go now. Good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you!&rdquo; replied the master, and he seemed as
though he would like to call him back and say another word to him.</p>
<p>In rather over a month Sandu had had time to get back into his old
ways, and to work hopefully at his trade, but during this time he had,
little by little, come to see that in his master&rsquo;s house the cock
by no means ruled the roost. Sharp-tongued and ill-tempered, Mistress
Veta was often dissatisfied with the work. Now it was because the skins
had not come out of the vat yellow enough, and had not enough creases;
now it was because a range of skins needed mending as the workmen had
not been sufficiently careful; and so on and so on, always hard words
for the workmen who worked eagerly and with all their might that the
skins might be well tanned, and the mistress have no chance to
grumble.</p>
<p>At first Sandu found these abusive words hard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>to
bear, and all day long the thought worried him that the mistress only
spoke so to him, and that it was with him only that she was
dissatisfied. At one time even he was seized with the desire to go away
so that he might hear her no longer, and the other men might not be
worried on his account, for he said to himself that only since he
entered the workshop had the work gone so badly, and the
mistress&rsquo;s tongue chided so unceasingly.</p>
<p>But, all unperceived by himself, he grew somewhat accustomed to the
ways of the house, and when a workman told him that the mistress had
always been just the same, and that no matter how well the hides were
dressed she always found some fault, he took heart and dismissed the
idea of quitting the workshop of Talpoane, the master-tanner.</p>
<p>He was up almost before daylight, and never let his work out of his
hand till it was dinner-time. He washed his hands clean, and took his
usual place at his employers&rsquo; table&mdash;for from olden times it
had been the custom for the masters not to keep aloof from the workmen
or to dine apart.</p>
<p>Silent at his work, he was, also, silent at meals. Only when he was
spoken to did Sandu reply, gently and with dignity. The other men
talked and laughed, and when they realized that it pleased the mistress
to make fun of Sandu they began to crack every kind of joke at his
expense.</p>
<p>At first Sandu opened his eyes wide. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>looked at them and could not understand them,
but when he took it in he, too, laughed with them, a laugh full of
kindness and friendliness. He lived on good terms with the workmen;
only one of them, Iotza, embittered the days. He only had to say:
&ldquo;You have made the solution too weak,&rdquo; for Sandu, although
he knew it was not true, to be unhappy all the week, and often his
heart was full of fear that the skins would not come out yellow enough
or creased enough to please the mistress.</p>
<p>But he felt comforted when he noticed that, when he came into the
workshop, Master Dinu asked only him how many hides were being worked,
and when they would be ready, for at such and such a fair he would need
so many, because a customer was trying to get in touch with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be ready when they are wanted; don&rsquo;t
worry,&rdquo; Sandu would reply.</p>
<p>And away Master Dinu would go, quite content, and quite sure that
the hides would be ready when they were wanted for the fair, or had to
be despatched to some customer.</p>
<p>He saw that everything went very well since Sandu entered the
workshop. The skins were kept in the pits just long enough for the hair
to come off easily and not burn in the lime; the solution was boiled
enough, not too hot and not too strong; the poles were in their places;
the stretching-pegs were in a neat pile, and the workshop was cleaner
than it had ever been before. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Master Dinu knew the value of a good workman in a place where
there were many workers, and where work was plentiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing he lacks,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;he would be a man in a thousand, but he is too
diffident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, even in spite of his diffidence, he thought so highly of him
that had he asked for four florins a week he would gladly have given it
sooner than let him go away.</p>
<p>So he said to himself, but Sandu did not dream of asking for much
more than he had. All his life he had worked for the same wage.</p>
<p>It is true that had he done as the others did, and drawn out money
every Sunday, he might, perhaps, have felt it was hard to see Master
Dinu paying out a great deal more to the others than to him, but he did
not ask for his money. On one occasion only did he draw two florins
from his pay, and that was because, on a certain Tuesday, his mother
had sent greetings to him and had asked him if possible to send her a
little help.</p>
<p>Sandu ran off at once to the market-place to find Master Dinu to ask
for all the money he was entitled to for his work, that he might send
it to his mother. Master Dinu, not knowing what he wanted it for, nor
how much he needed, asked whether two florins would be enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, and with the coins in his hand he went
to the man from his village. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>wrapped up the money and
begged him to lose no time in giving it to his mother and in telling
her how much he longed for her, and that, perhaps, she might come to
him, for he was working for a good master, and up to now he had not
been idle for a single day.</p>
<p>A fortnight passed and he received no tidings of his mother. But on
Tuesday, the day of the weekly fair, while he was spreading out the
skins, the man came to tell him he had given the money and had brought
a letter written by &ldquo;Peter the Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu took the letter and would have liked to open it, but he caught
the mistress&rsquo;s eye and involuntarily thrust it into his
breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we are longing to
finish the work quickly, and he thinks only of reading lines from his
sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no sweetheart,&rdquo; <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e3722" title="Source: repiled">replied</span> Sandu gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who writes to you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother? She can&rsquo;t know how to use a pen. Did you
ever hear such a lie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not lie? Hold your tongue! As if your mother knows how to
write&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And she looked rather sulkily at Sandu, who
moved on to the other pile of stretching-pegs.</p>
<p>At this moment one of the workmen told her that the letter really
was from his mother, but that it was written by a Chinaman in the
village. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t he tell me?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Am
I supposed to know everything?&rdquo; Sandu turned round. &ldquo;But
can you read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mistress, I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mistress went away and the men were busy with their work till
dinner-time.</p>
<p>Sandu lingered over his letter. When he went indoors the mistress
could not resist having one or two hits at him. But Sandu scarcely
understood her; his mother thanked him with all her heart, and he was
so full of joy that even had the mistress struck him he would have felt
nothing of it. He ate of the food, but he could not have told if he
were satisfied or hungry when he got up from the table, and he worked
like a nigger till the evening.</p>
<p>In bed, with his hands beneath his head, many thoughts crossed his
mind. Three years had passed since last he saw his mother. He had often
longed for her when he was in the army, but only from time to time had
he received news of her. He had left her old and poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And longing for me will have aged her a great deal
more,&rdquo; he said to himself, and his heart was heavy when he
thought he could not go to see her. &ldquo;How good it would be if I
could go and see her at Christmas! In the meantime I must send more
money to give her pleasure and console her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he fancied how she would cry with joy when she got the money,
and how she would pray <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>God to lengthen his life and give
him success and happiness.</p>
<p>And he seemed to feel himself close to her, and he seemed to hear
the whisper of sweet comforting words.</p>
<p>Wrapped in such thoughts as these he fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next day God sent glorious weather, and Sandu beat the skins
carefully and often that they might dry quickly.</p>
<p>But no matter what trouble he and the other men took, the skins
would not dry, and Master Dinu could not begin the cutting out till
next day; the cutting out and trimming goes quickly when one has
everything close at hand, and some one to help one, and Master Dinu
began to cut out and to trim. But the damping, oiling, thickening and
sewing of the sandals and straps was difficult and tedious.</p>
<p>There being great need of haste, Master Dinu told his wife to call
Ana, their daughter, that she might help to damp the sandals.</p>
<p>The mistress, who was holding the skins to make it easier for Dinu
to cut out the straps, and trim them after cutting out, put her hands
on her hips and looked at her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, my Ana damp the sandals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his wife&rsquo;s words Master Dinu stayed the knife in the middle
of the skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not a smart lady, is she, and you are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>not
going to marry her to some grandee? There is no disgrace to her in
coming to give a little help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife lost her temper. Her daughter damp sandals! Her daughter
associate with the men! Her daughter, who had gone to school to the
nuns for so many years! Her daughter, who knew how to sew so
beautifully! Her daughter, who was friends with the niece of one
important person, and the inseparable companion of the daughters of
another! Her daughter to handle the sandals and make her fingers smell
of bark!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; she said, hoarse
with anger, &ldquo;even if you do not know how to behave properly, you
need not insult your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insult?&rdquo; questioned Master Dinu.</p>
<p>But his wife rushed from the room.</p>
<p>He looked long after her, then glanced at the workmen, took up the
knife with a nervous movement, and began quickly to cut out the
sandals.</p>
<p>The workmen, who had heard the words exchanged, and seen the abrupt
departure of the mistress, kept complete silence and busied themselves
with their work.</p>
<p>Master Dinu finished cutting the skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might hurry yourselves a little when you know the work
ought to be ready,&rdquo; he said to the men, and departed, hanging his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very unhappy is Master Dinu,&rdquo; said Iotza, looking after
him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; one of them asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because those are the sharpest words I have ever heard
coming from his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was unusually quiet, only the little boy whined and asked for
first one thing and then another. His mother gave him one or two raps
over the knuckles to make him sit still and be silent, but the child
began to cry, and she angrily sent him into the next room.</p>
<p>Master Dinu said never a word and his daughter, Ana, looked round
her in a frightened manner, and would like to have asked what had
happened to-day to make them all so downcast.</p>
<p>Sandu had seen her many times, but he had never seen her well. He
knew she was the master&rsquo;s daughter. He greeted her when she came
to the table, but speak to her or look her really in the face, that, up
till to-day, he had never done.</p>
<p>But when he saw her looking sadly, now at her father, now at her
mother, and then at the others seated round the table, he wanted to say
something to her to cheer her and make her laugh. But he had nothing to
tell her, he could not find a word, and when their eyes met he felt as
though he were being swept away by a storm, and carried he knew not
whither.</p>
<p>Ana was so beautiful and so graceful. With her white hands and her
fair face one would never have believed her to be the daughter of an
artisan. Her big blue eyes, so full of kindness, were shaded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>by black eyelashes, and when she laughed
one&rsquo;s heart glowed in the joyous sound, and one wished one could
often hear her laughing.</p>
<p>Iotza&mdash;he had been workman with Dinu for a long time&mdash;when
the mistress was out of the house, had more than once asked her to mend
something for him, and not infrequently she had brought him drink from
the cellar when the frost was sharp and he had complained that he could
not stand the cold. And with all his prudence Iotza had let drop a word
in the workshop in praise of Ana&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>And so it came about that they all waited for the mistress to go out
that they might speak to Ana and ask her one thing or another.</p>
<p>Only Sandu had never been to her. And that was why he especially
wanted now to divert her thoughts and make her smile.</p>
<p>Her eyes troubled him, and he felt happier when he found himself
back in the workshop.</p>
<p>One day, according to the allotment of the work, it was his duty to
turn the skins in the vats full of birch bark solution. He was alone in
the workshop, he could work in peace, but he often let the stick fall
from his hand, for, unlike other days, that day the fumes made him
perspire, and he did not notice whether the skins were thoroughly
turned. There was one vat more to turn when the door opened gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Sandu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu raised his head as though he were in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>dream, wiped away the sweat, and looked at Ana
as one looks at a person one does not the least expect to see. He
wanted to say something to her, but a lump rose in his throat. Ana came
nearer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, I came to tell you to put the sandals in the box after
you have turned the skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied Sandu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what Father said,&rdquo; and away she
went.</p>
<p>Outside she met Iotza, and passed him in such a hurry that she did
not hear his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sandu, what did Ana want in the workshop?&rdquo; he
asked as he threw his apron behind a vat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Sandu, who was disappointed at not
talking longer with Ana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing? Well, well! Listen, have you turned the
skins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you filled the boiler with water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much have you put? You have not filled it! Bring two more
bucketfuls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you pour two more bucketfuls in when it does not hold
more than one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not hold more? I tell you plainly you have been too
lazy to bring more, and who knows how you have turned the
skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu grew red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iotza, I learnt my work from the master and not from the
workman.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230"
name="pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next is, that I don&rsquo;t need your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; cried Iotza, and went off.</p>
<p>Three days later the mistress came to the workshop; she walked about
here and there, and after a while she looked at the vats and took out a
skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who turned this vat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Sandu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much! Now you&mdash;just come and look at your
work! That&rsquo;s how you turned it; that&rsquo;s what the solution is
like; that&rsquo;s the kind of work you get paid for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu went up to the vat feeling as though he had been struck on the
head. The solution was yellow, the skins were yellow and creased as
usual, and he could not understand what fault the mistress had to
find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him so,&rdquo; said Iotza, interfering in the
conversation; and as he opened the door to take out a bundle of bark,
he added: &ldquo;But he knows everything, and doesn&rsquo;t need advice
from anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; scolded the mistress, &ldquo;you did not
have time to turn the skins; you stood talking, and took no heed of
your work. What was Ana looking for here the day before
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana&mdash;Ana came to tell me to put away the sandals in the
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you could not do that much without being told? You are
the kind of man one must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>tell everything to, otherwise
there would not be much use in your work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time Sandu stayed alone in the workshop; he felt as though
he could not move. His mistress&rsquo;s words rang continually in his
ears, and he felt numbed by their harshness.</p>
<p>The apprentice had come to call him to dinner, but he had not gone.
It seemed to him they had all heard what the mistress said, and would
have stared at him.</p>
<p>Iotza and the other man returned from dinner and found him in the
workshop, his hand resting on the vat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when you had turned the skins, didn&rsquo;t you come to
dinner, or have you been talking to Ana?&rdquo; sneered Iotza.</p>
<p>Sandu heard his voice, but he did not take in what he said. He
looked at him with great sad eyes, and not knowing what to do went
outside.</p>
<p>Sandu rose at daybreak the following day, but he could not have told
if he had slept, or whether his thoughts had tormented him all night.
He left the workshop without having done anything, he went to the pits,
and took the skins out with the pincers to try whether they were ready
to dress, then he returned to the workshop and was still quite
unsettled.</p>
<p>He went to dinner with the other men; he followed them; had anyone
asked him whither he was going he could not have told them. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>were alone, and all quite silent, and just this
silence was painful to Sandu. He would have liked to hear conversation,
a great deal of talking. They were about to rise from the table when
the mistress arrived. Everything seemed to turn black before
Sandu&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words, Iotza said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress, you better let me turn the skins in those two
vats&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you turn them, just like Sandu did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood rushed to his head as Sandu dropped his knife and spilt a
piece of lard upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I shall pity you because you don&rsquo;t eat?
You have not turned them well, and that&rsquo;s all. I didn&rsquo;t
begin to keep a workshop to-day or yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s always mistress, mistress! Do your work
properly, and don&rsquo;t let your thoughts go wandering far afield,
then no one need find fault with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workmen rose. Sandu got up too; his feet could hardly carry him,
and his head was heavy.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>For two whole days Sandu did not know whether he was himself or some
one else. He could not take his food, sleep only came to him at rare
intervals. And during this time he often thought of going to Master
Dinu and giving him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233"
name="pb233">233</a>]</span>notice. Several times he had left the
workshop determined to tell him, but once Iotza had called him to come
and help with something, and then he had thought it over and had left
it to a more suitable time when he should find Dinu alone, for in front
of the mistress he could have said nothing to him.</p>
<p>And who knows whether he would have said anything, if Master Dinu
had not come through the workshop. He asked him how the skins were
getting on, and then, as he never cared to prolong a conversation, he
prepared to go, after telling him that one lot of work must be pressed
forward, and the other done in such and such a way.</p>
<p>Sandu had followed him but the words died upon his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Sandu? Do you want to tell me
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Master Dinu, without any offence to you, I want to give
up the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Dinu looked long at him. He was prepared for anything except
this, and just now when the fairs were in full swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to give me notice? But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the mistress is always abusing me, and she is not
satisfied with the way I work, and Iotza makes fun of me, and I can
bear it no longer: it is too hard. I work with all my might, and I want
to do good work, and I don&rsquo;t want you to keep me just out of
charity as people say you do.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t do that; you know the mistress, that is her
way. As for Iotza&mdash;listen, I&rsquo;ll stop his mouth. And, then,
where would you find another place? Take my advice and let me talk to
the mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Dinu went away, and Sandu returned to the workshop. Before he
had spoken with Master Dinu he had not seemed to realize whether there
was work to finish, and now he did not know whether he had finished it
or not.</p>
<p>Master Dinu went into the house. He told his wife that Sandu had
wished to leave, and bade her leave him in peace from now on, seeing
that he was an industrious workman and an honest man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied his wife; &ldquo;let me tell you
that I take as much interest in the workshop as you do, and if I am not
to be allowed to speak to the workmen, or give them orders about the
work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say you are not to give them orders, but you are not
to make fun of them. After all, they are human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am in the wrong! If I tell them how they are to do
something I am making fun of the men; impertinent man, to accuse me of
joking. And why didn&rsquo;t you send him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him away? Why? Just now when we are greatly in need of
men? I rack my brains to try and get another hand for the work, and
don&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>know where to find one, while you are longing to
get rid of Sandu, and in the long run, for no reason. You must not be
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still talking when Nitza Burencea came to ask if he was
going to the fair at Devi.</p>
<p>That evening, after supper, the mistress stopped Sandu as she wanted
to send him somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, why did you want to leave your work? Are you not
satisfied with our food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or don&rsquo;t we give you enough whisky in the
evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink it? But, you silly man, why didn&rsquo;t
you tell me? And those other two said nothing about it&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t think it rains whisky with us, do you? They have drawn your
share all these days. But I&rsquo;ll wipe their mouths for them. Why
did you not tell me long ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go where I tell you; and, listen, if I send you it is
because I have not got so much confidence in the others; do just what I
have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so, mistress,&rdquo; replied Sandu, with a much
lighter heart.</p>
<p>When he reached the street he told himself the mistress was not so
bad after all.</p>
<p>An hour later, when he returned, only Ana was downstairs.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>After saying good evening, seeing that Ana was by herself, he
prepared to go out again.</p>
<p>Ana, who saw he was about to open the door, asked him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Sandu? Whom are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wait for her, she will soon come. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu seated himself on the edge of a chair.</p>
<p>Ana was sewing; he watched her hands with their rapid movements, and
his eyes were absorbed in looking at something more beautiful than he
had ever seen before. Ana felt she was being watched. This idea seemed
to hurry her, and she grasped her needle and began to sew quickly. The
more intently he watched her, the more embarrassed did Ana become, and
a rosy flush mantled her cheeks. A sort of fever came over her, and in
her innermost soul she was picturing Sandu to herself, how he was
sitting on the chair with his black eyes fixed upon her, and his eyes
were so beautiful and so eloquent, and Sandu was good-looking. She
could bear it no longer, his look seemed to burn her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, why do you look at me like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;was not looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence followed. Their souls seemed to draw near each other
in the silent room; they spoke no word, but it was as though they told
each other many things and understood each other very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>well. He was very conscious of her, so near to
him, her light breath was almost inaudible, but it made his heart beat
fast; she was very conscious of him, and something intangible but sweet
seemed to invade their hearts.</p>
<p>She felt as though she could not sew, and he found it hard to look
at her. He was afraid of offending her and he was shy, and he felt he
should be ashamed for her to find his glance resting upon her
hands.</p>
<p>He kept his head down. But Ana would have liked to look at him, she
would have liked to bask in the light of his eyes, for she felt happy
enveloped in their warm glow.</p>
<p>Sandu did not lift his head. She dropped her ball of thread. Roused
by the noise, Sandu jumped as though he had been burnt. He searched
under the table and saw it.</p>
<p>She forgot to thank him, and he could not say a word, but their eyes
met and they both blushed.</p>
<p>The time passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistress does not come,&rdquo; said Sandu a little later,
&ldquo;and I wanted to tell her that I had to stay some time where she
sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will soon come,&rdquo; replied Ana. &ldquo;Sandu, you
told Mother that I had been in the workshop?&rdquo; she suddenly
questioned, looking straight at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who can have told her?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not I, and I do not know who it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Mother scolded me! And she said I had stayed a long while
talking to you. Was I a long time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; you just came to tell me to put the sandals in
the boxes, and then you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Mother like my talking to you when Father
says you are so good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing; she stopped; and a few moments later the mistress
came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing you are back. I was waiting for
you,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I nearly sent some one after
you; you are very slow. Now, come and tell me what you have
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the ante-room he told her what he had arranged with her aunt, and
then went off to bed.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. The men had little work to do, and by ten
o&rsquo;clock they were free. As usual on feast days there was wine on
the table, and Master Dinu, having bought some thirty skins much more
easily than he had expected to, was more cheerful than usual.</p>
<p>Sandu was more forthcoming than was his wont, and had washed and
brushed himself extra well to-day. Ana, too, was smart, smart as
always, but she had no time to sit as she had constantly to jump up to
help her mother. Every now and then she threw a glance at Sandu, and a
strange feeling of joy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>possessed her that he could see
her, that he looked at her.</p>
<p>Only the mistress was as usual, and when the child complained
constantly that his head ached she wanted the meal to finish quickly.
She laid a wet handkerchief on his forehead and put him to bed. The
child became quieter, and Master Dinu, after drinking the wine that was
left over, rose from the table&mdash;a signal that the meal was
finished. Then, according to his usual habit, he took up his hat,
inquired if anyone wanted any money, gave Iotza what he asked, and went
off into the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu,&rdquo; said the mistress, when the workmen had gone,
&ldquo;if you are not going anywhere, come back in an hour when we have
finished with the dinner things and sit with Gheorghitza, for to-day is
Sunday and perhaps visitors will come to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana looked at him; Sandu hardly understood the mistress&rsquo;s
words, and could not answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, are you coming or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come.&rdquo; And he went out as though he had been
pushed.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock came the mistress&rsquo;s mother, a woman of
about sixty years of age, rosy in the face and well made. She was
wearing a dark coloured skirt, and on her head a kerchief of black silk
which reached nearly to her knees, and in her hand, like all old women,
she carried a yellow handkerchief.</p>
<p>She rarely came to see her daughter, partly because she knew her
time for going out in society <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>was past, but especially
because Mistress Veta was not glad to see her on feast days; she would
not have come to-day, but she had not been for a long time and she was
desirous of seeing her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Inside the front room she rejoiced over the beauty and good manners
of her grand-daughter, who, with her mother, was removing the last
speck of dust, or putting back in its right place anything that had
been left about.</p>
<p>Ana sat down by her grandmother, and her grandmother stroked her
head and looked tenderly into her face. She never grew tired of saying:
&ldquo;Such grandchildren, such dear grandchildren.&rdquo; But just
when she was feeling happy the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Naraschievici!&rdquo; said Mistress Veta,
jumping up to receive them as though some royal party had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Naraschievici accepted the invitation, while their
daughter, a pale, plain girl of over twenty years of age, did not
forget to kiss the mistress&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kiss your hand, aunt,&rdquo; said Ana, too, while Mrs.
Naraschievici in her turn embraced her on the forehead, and could not
help expressing her wonder at how tall Ana had grown and how pretty she
was.</p>
<p>Ana blushed and joined Miss Naraschievici, while the
mistress&rsquo;s eyes shone with pleasure. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not tell her so; you must not turn her head,&rdquo;
she said, just for something to say, while her mother was asking
herself the question as to why on earth her grand-daughter had said
that &ldquo;Aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that neither Ana nor Mistress Veta was related to the
Naraschievici family; however, Mr. Naraschievici said it was
&ldquo;aristocratic,&rdquo; and all he said was right in Mistress
Veta&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Master Dinu at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You know what he is&mdash;he cannot bear to stay at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she said this, Mistress Veta approached her mother, who looked as
if she could have taken the whole Naraschievici family and put them
outside the door, so angry was she because they had spoilt the happy
hour she had hoped to pass with her grand-daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she whispered in her ear, &ldquo;it would be
kind if you would go downstairs to Gheorghitza, who ought to be up
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady was at the door before she had finished speaking: with
her hand on the latch she looked furiously at her daughter and at Mr.
and Mrs. Naraschievici, choked back some words and went out.</p>
<p>She was going away, saying to herself that she would never again set
foot inside the house, when she remembered Gheorghitza. When the old
lady went in Sandu was telling him tales. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is kind Granny, here is kind Granny,&rdquo; cried
Gheorghitza gaily.</p>
<p>He got up quickly, put his arms round her neck and kissed her over
and over again.</p>
<p>The old woman forgot her distress as she held Gheorghitza in her
arms. He began to untie the handkerchief and feel in the pocket of her
gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what Granny has brought for Gheorghitza,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>It was her habit to bring some toy for him.</p>
<p>Now that he had a plaything, Gheorghitza was no longer ill. His kind
Granny made him forget it. The old lady watched him for some time, and
then she looked at Sandu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the work getting on<span class="corr" id="xd19e4116"
title="Source: !">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And business is profitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sandu said this Mistress Veta came into the ante-room, took a
plateful of cakes out of a cupboard and went quickly away again.</p>
<p>During the noise she made the old lady looked intently towards the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She takes them upstairs, but she did not invite me,&rdquo;
and her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;That is how she esteems
me,&rdquo; said the old lady, steeped in bitterness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a sad world. I have reached an old age when my own daughter is ashamed
of me. She sends me out of the house as if I were a nobody. May God not
punish her, for she has children. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>But it hurts me to see her
pay no attention to me just because of some bankrupts, some wretches
who have fled from Temishoara to avoid their creditors. But I did not
come to get something out of her. I did not come like those bankrupts
to get something to eat. Thank God I have all I need at home, but that
she should belittle me in such a way as to make me ridiculous in their
eyes&mdash;Lord, Lord, did I rear her for this? Is it for this I
watched over her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu,&rdquo; said the old lady, sighing heavily, &ldquo;give
her my thanks, tell her how I appreciate the honour she has done me,
and that all my life I shall never forget that she received me as she
should receive her mother. But listen to me; tell her, too, she may
wait a long time before I cross her threshold again, and she need not
send to me when she wants anything. Let her go to the gentleman, to the
bankrupt Naraschievici.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went Mistress Veta&rsquo;s mother, so angry that she could
not see where she was walking, while Sandu sat with drooping head.</p>
<p>In about half an hour Ana came. She was disappointed to hear her
grandmother had gone, and wanted to know why.</p>
<p>Sandu did not like to tell her, and because his heart would not let
him lie he said to her in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she went because she could not stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana sat on the edge of the bed, and sympathizing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>with
her brother, she asked him whether his head ached.</p>
<p>Gheorghitza had no time to answer; he shook his head and went on
playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, can you stay with him? You see, I must go up again.
Gheorghitza dear, be good and play nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she kissed him and went slowly away as though she were loth to
go.</p>
<p>And with her went Sandu&rsquo;s heart and the joy which filled his
soul when he saw her standing by her brother and kissing him so
tenderly.</p>
<p>Mistress Veta was beside herself with pleasure that evening. She did
not even ask when or why her mother had gone so suddenly. She told
Sandu that he was not to dare to tell her what the old lady had said,
but to go and get wood to make a fire to warm the supper. And once
again she went over in her mind all that Mr. and Mrs. Naraschievici had
said. She felt very flattered, and said she did not remember when she
had spent such a pleasant day.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>There was a heavy frost and the Timish was frozen. The tanners were
obliged to have openings made in the ice to enable the rinsing of the
skins to take place.</p>
<p>Sandu, shod in big working boots, made his way through the thick
mist and came down to the Timish to rinse a set of skins. Behind him
came the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>apprentice with a barrow containing the block of
wood with its stand, the rinser and two hatchets for breaking the ice.
They made the opening in the ice and Sandu remained alone. He fixed one
end of the block on to a stake and arranged the stand firmly under the
other, opened out two skins, placed them one over the other, on the
block, and began to work.</p>
<p>Sandu was hardened and accustomed to the cold, but however fast he
worked his breath froze and his hands grew stiff. Seldom at first, but
then more and more frequently did he stamp his feet. He put the rinser
on the block, breathed into the palms of his hands, and swinging his
arms he beat under his left arm with his right hand, and then under the
right arm with his left hand, to make his blood circulate, the while
his eyes watered with the cold.</p>
<p>Round him was a frosty calm; the gurgling of the water as he turned
the skins made him realize all the more the severity of the winter. He
worked away at his task, but slowly, and with little result. It was
getting towards noon, and he had rinsed five skins when he heard a
crunching of the snow on the bank, and raised his head.</p>
<p>The rinser dropped from his hand. On the bank was Ana with a jug in
her hand, wishing him &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu did not know how to answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, see what I have brought you, a drop of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>warm
wine, for Mother is out, and you must be cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu came up the bank; he could hardly hold the jug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said with his mouth, but his heart spoke
from his eyes.</p>
<p>Ana looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink quickly,&rdquo; she said, so softly she could scarcely
be heard, &ldquo;for I must not stay long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu drank the wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana, Miss Ana&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana drew back her hand, and looking at him in a way I cannot
describe, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you warmer now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu&rsquo;s eyes were too eloquent, the peaceful isolation was too
tempting, the stillness of the atmosphere was too intense, their hearts
were too attuned for them not to understand each other.</p>
<p>She went up to him with an eager movement, and he put his arm about
her waist and clasped her to his heart.</p>
<p>They neither of them said a word, but to them both it seemed that no
words were needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, I must go, I must really go, for Mother might
come,&rdquo; and gently she disengaged herself from his arms, took a
few slow steps, turned round, and then fled like a little kid towards
the house.</p>
<p>While Sandu was watching her, Costa came along; he, too, was a
master-tanner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Talpoane&rsquo;s hands live well. What <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>a
moment for me to arrive,&rdquo; murmured Costa in his beard, smiling as
he thought of the story he would be able to tell. &ldquo;Sandu,&rdquo;
he shouted, &ldquo;I was going to see you, but as you are at the
rinsing I have come down to ask you whether the hides which I have been
waiting for these three days have come from Pesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they have not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not? Why the devil haven&rsquo;t they sent them? Have you
much work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many hides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot. Yes, I know you have a lot, but how many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not counted them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got business at Hunedoar fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so; the drying is difficult, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got some heavy skins, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some heavy, some light; you know how it is with the
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Costa bit his lips and would like to have given Sandu a cuff or two,
so angry was he that he would not tell him what he was longing to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, you ought not to feel it much when Talpoane&rsquo;s
daughter brings you drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood rushed to Sandu&rsquo;s face, and he did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>not
know why he did not strike Costa to the ground as he smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of it, haven&rsquo;t we all done the same kind of
thing? Only look out that nobody sees you and nobody hears you.
That&rsquo;s all right, I won&rsquo;t keep you from your
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu could not see, everything was black before his eyes, he was
hot all over and a fire seemed to burn within him. He gnashed his teeth
and stretched the skin as though he would tear it, and rinsed as though
he had some rival to surpass.</p>
<p>At midday the apprentice came to call him to dinner. On the way he
remembered what had happened and would have liked to turn back. In the
ante-room he saw Ana, and his heart beat as though it were on fire.
Ana, too, was radiant, her eyes laughed with joy, and the dimples in
her cheeks were more tantalizing than ever. Sandu&rsquo;s heart was
full of delight; he forgot what Costa had said; he was only conscious
of Ana&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>After dinner the cold was not quite so cruel, the calm was not so
intense, and he did not feel alone; there seemed to be plenty of life
around him, but whenever he turned his head he could only see
Ana<span class="corr" id="xd19e4257" title="Not in source">.</span> And
longings awoke in his heart, and many pleasant thoughts passed through
his mind, and they all gathered round Ana&rsquo;s form. His thoughts
carried him far, and he pictured himself with a workshop and a house of
his own, and Ana beside him making life sweet. They were so tempting
and so full of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>charm that Sandu smiled to himself as he strung
together tender, caressing words to say to Ana, for he felt she
belonged to him, and no one could disturb the peace of these happy
days.</p>
<p>Night closed sadly in and Sandu had long ago finished his work, but
he did not want to move. He was loath to leave the pleasant, quiet spot
where he had pictured to himself the path in life that was awaiting
him. He gave a sigh of regret as he stepped along the bank and walked
towards the house of Mistress Veta.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The nearer it drew to the Christmas festival the busier became the
fairs, and the tanners raised the price of their goods because the
weather was moist, and the peasants were obliged to buy sandals whether
they wanted to or not.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve fell on a Tuesday, and, accordingly, the weekly fair
had never been better.</p>
<p>Although Mistress Veta had such a lot to do that she had hardly time
to turn round, she remained at the booth till ten o&rsquo;clock, when
she returned home.</p>
<p>The little white, crown-shaped rolls were baked and divided up, some
for the house, some for the poor, and some for the guests who would
expect hospitality the day after Christmas Day. When everything was
finished and put ready, and Master Dinu arrived, they all went into the
front room. There they lit a fire that must not be allowed to die
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>out, that Christ, who was born on this night,
might not feel the cold, and there they quietly waited till their house
was visited by carol-singers and lads carrying &ldquo;Stars&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Magi.&rdquo; To make the joy next day more complete, they lit
the Christmas Tree, and out of a cupboard Master Dinu took a little
riding-horse for Gheorghitza, and for Ana a work-frame and other things
suitable for a big girl. The parents were happy at the gratitude
written on their children&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>Gradually the world seemed to wake up, the quiet in the town was
dispelled. As the stars rose in the sky, there appeared in every
street, girls carrying &ldquo;Christmas Trees,&rdquo; boys with
&ldquo;Stars&rdquo; or &ldquo;Magi&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Manger,&rdquo;
and young men with &ldquo;carols,&rdquo; and amidst this busy movement,
amidst this pleasant noise, amidst slow, sad songs or beautiful carols,
the whole town seemed enveloped in an atmosphere of reverence; each
one, forgetting the troubles of life, felt himself drawing nearer to
the glory of God.</p>
<p>While Master Dinu was listening to the carol-singers from his
windows, and taking the symbol of the Magi into his house, Sandu sat
alone in the workshop over the way. He had lit an end of candle, and
was sitting on a chair in front of the opening in the stove below the
boiler.</p>
<p>At intervals a drop of liquid fell from the vats, and the sound of
its fall echoed long in the quiet workshop.</p>
<p>The noise from outside broke dully against the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>window and took Sandu&rsquo;s thoughts back to
other days. And all at once he began to carol to himself:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And as you journey thither</p>
<p class="line">There comes wafted many a mile,</p>
<p class="line">From where the Holy Infant lies,</p>
<p class="line">The scent of fair flowers,</p>
<p class="line">The glow of bright torches,</p>
<p class="line">The smoke of the incense,</p>
<p class="line">The song of the angels.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He sang softly, and the dead past of the years he had
spent since he left the home where he was born seemed to unroll itself
before him. And as he saw himself alone, and deprived of every kind of
pleasure, a tear crept into his eye, and with his head resting upon his
hand, he sat gazing into the fire. All the nine years that he had spent
Christmas among strangers, he had envied the joy of others, and never
once had he felt in his heart the peace of the season as he used to in
the days when he was at home. And who would think of him, or who would
give him any happiness at this holy festival?</p>
<p>The workshop door opened hastily, and the appearance of Ana
scattered his thoughts to the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, I have brought you something for Christmas.&rdquo;
Sandu did not hold out his hand for it. &ldquo;How you look at me,
Sandu! Why do you not want what I bring you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Ana came quite close to him, and put what she had brought
into his hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana,&rdquo; said Sandu, in a stifled voice, &ldquo;may God
look upon you as I look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice seemed to come from the depths of his soul, and
Ana&rsquo;s look grew troubled. The kindness and sorrow with which he
spoke touched her strangely, and resting her head upon his breast she
murmured as in a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, dear Sandu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had to go, for she had stolen from the house when some boys,
carrying Magi, had arrived, and her mother would be looking for
her.</p>
<p>Sandu remained behind to tell himself that never had God given him a
happier Christmas.</p>
<p>The day after Christmas, in the afternoon, his various god-children
came to Master Dinu&rsquo;s house: hospitality demands hospitality.
They brought with them rolls and other things. Mistress Veta spread
food upon the table, and whoever came took in exchange a roll from the
god-parents.</p>
<p>By the evening, Lena, Tziru&rsquo;s widow, alone remained.</p>
<p>Master Dinu was in a hurry to get away, and Ana was downstairs with
some friends.</p>
<p>The women remained by themselves, enjoying the wine and conversing.
And when two women sit gossiping, who escapes unscathed by their
tongues? One person is so and so, another person dresses so absurdly
that every one laughs at her, and so the idle talk runs on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you laugh&rdquo;&mdash;Mistress Veta
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>takes up the word&mdash;&ldquo;when you see
Costa&rsquo;s wife as pink as a girl? How can a woman of her age paint
herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind her, my dear, there are
others&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to have heard of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a little later on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is but Costa is an ill-natured man
and a regular chatterbox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say truly, it&rsquo;s the talk of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has become a little more careful, he&rsquo;s not as he
was a while ago. He has begun to shrug his shoulders only and keep his
tongue quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pretends to, my dear, but you have not heard
him&mdash;it&rsquo;s better for me not to tell you, not to make you
unhappy, especially on a feast day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you must tell me,&rdquo; Mistress Veta raised her
voice and her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would sooner you heard it from other lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Lena, either you tell me, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena knew Mistress Veta too well not to tell her that Costa was
saying how he had seen Ana going down to the Timish with warm wine for
Sandu, and how she had stood in the cold for two hours talking to him,
and a great deal more besides.</p>
<p>Red was the wine, but Mistress Veta&rsquo;s face was redder still.
She might have had an apoplectic stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! He said those words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena did not know how to calm her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, really I did not know how much it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>would upset you or I should never have told you.
Why do you get so angry? Every one knows he is a liar and a
mischief-maker without his equal in the empire, and who pays attention
to all his tales, and all the world knows how you have brought up Ana.
What tanner&rsquo;s daughter can touch her? Your Ana&mdash;come, leave
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not leave it,&rdquo; cried Mistress Veta, somewhat
calmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him. To whom did he say these
words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know to whom he said them; I heard of it in
Trifu&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Trifu&rsquo;s house! Trifu is his cousin. Don&rsquo;t
listen, Lena; do you believe his lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I believe him, my dear, how could I believe him?
Neither did Trifu believe him. He said he would blush to invent such
lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, Lena, lies. But let him see me! My
daughter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more about it, Veta. May God keep Ana well, and you
see her happy. Costa&mdash;but who&rsquo;s Costa? Everybody laughs when
he opens his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard it in Trifu&rsquo;s house! Who knows in how many
places he has spit out his libels, for that man spits, Lena, he spits
worse than any cat; but I am not I if I don&rsquo;t pay him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lena agreed with her, and sympathized with her and urged her not to
be so angry, for the whole town knew what Ana&rsquo;s behaviour always
was, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>people stood still and looked after her when she
passed by, sweet and modest as a rosebud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why let yourself be unhappy, my dear?&rdquo; she said,
getting up to go, &ldquo;when every one&rsquo;s heart swells when they
see Ana, as if she were not the pride of us all when we see her going
about with gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters. Ana is just herself, and there
is no one like her, so why give yourself bad moments because of the
tittle-tattle of a man like Costa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Veta accompanied Lena to the door, and came back asking
herself what was to be done.</p>
<p>Master Dinu came back just at the right moment.</p>
<p>Without much hesitation his wife told him everything with various
additions and improvements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! And what of it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t the
people know us and our daughter, and don&rsquo;t they know what
Costa&rsquo;s words are worth? Only Costa says it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Veta looked furiously at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! The town is talking about your daughter, and you
don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t mind! Of course I mind, but
what would you have me do? Go and kill him? Don&rsquo;t be like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not be like this? I&rsquo;d better be like you and not care
when they insult my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, what am I to do?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you to do? Woe betide the house where the man is not
a real man! Find out, discover to whom he has said it, collect
witnesses, and see he never opens his mouth again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see about it, find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Dinu knew that his wife must always have the last word, so he
said nothing; he would have been glad not to be at home, but he could
not go now. A few minutes later he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Veta, all right, I will find witnesses, but supposing
it&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True?&rdquo; screamed his wife, and looked as though she
could have thrown herself upon him and struck him. &ldquo;True? Why
doesn&rsquo;t God strangle the word in your throat?&rdquo; she snarled,
and hurriedly left the room.</p>
<p>A few seconds later she returned with Ana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana, hear your father say that it is true you took warm wine
to Sandu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The haste with which her mother had called her, and her
father&rsquo;s expression so overcame her, that she stood with drooping
head, and raising a corner of her apron began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where we have got to&mdash;get out of my sight
that I may never see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Veta sank exhausted on to a chair, while Ana sobbed as if
her heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all this to-do even if she did take wine to the poor man?
What is the great harm in that? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257"
href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>She took him wine because he
was cold, and because I told her to go,&rdquo; said Master Dinu, going
up to Ana. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry any more,&rdquo; and he stroked her
forehead.</p>
<p>Ana continued to sob, and clung more and more tightly to her father.
Master Dinu felt as if his heart would break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and kiss your mother&rsquo;s hand, it&rsquo;s nothing.
Veta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let her get out of my sight, let her go. Ana has done
this to me, my prudent daughter, my good daughter, my much-praised
daughter, her mother&rsquo;s joy&mdash;she has done this,&rdquo; and
Mistress Veta shook her head while everything seemed to turn black
before her eyes.</p>
<p>Master Dinu did not know what to do. To put an end to it, he drew
Ana gently outside, and tried to quiet her sobs.</p>
<p>A little later he returned to the house. His wife was exhausted and
depressed, and sat gazing at the floor.</p>
<p>Suddenly she rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinu, you must give Sandu notice to-day, do you hear? If you
don&rsquo;t go now and tell him never to show himself here again,
you&rsquo;ll never have any peace from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I dismiss the man in the middle of the night? You
must see we cannot&mdash;and then, what harm has he done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Veta could have killed him with a look. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give him notice, do you understand? Or I will turn
him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Veta, we will give him notice, but what stories
will be told about us outside! How we dismiss workmen on feast days,
and turn them out of the house in the dead of night. You must be
patient. To-morrow I will give him all the money due to him, and tell
him to go in God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your business to deal with him; never let me see
him again; if they make any fuss I&rsquo;ll scratch his eyes out. He
has got us talked about, no other than he, do you hear? Let him get out
of my workshop, or there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early next day, Master Dinu went to the workshop and called to
Sandu.</p>
<p>He found it difficult, and he much regretted having to part with
him, but there was nothing else to be done. He asked him how long he
had been in his workshop, what money he had drawn, and made the
calculation as to how much he had still to receive.</p>
<p>Sandu felt as if the house were falling about his ears&mdash;he
could not keep him any longer? The blow was a heavy one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have twenty-seven florins to come to you,&rdquo; said
Master Dinu, and he did not seem to have the courage to look Sandu in
the face. &ldquo;Here are thirty, so that you do not lose your daily
pay up to the beginning of next week. May God give you good fortune,
you are a good man, and an honest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>but I&mdash;I can no longer
keep you. I am sorry, but I cannot help it. God be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying, Master Dinu went away.</p>
<p>Lost in thought Sandu stood gazing in front of him, seeing nothing.
After a while he sighed heavily, picked up his money, and with a heart
that seemed turned to ice he went off to collect all he had, poor man,
in the way of clothes and linen, before he took the road.</p>
<p>He collected all his possessions, but he could not make up his mind
to take leave of the men with whom he had worked so long. Even Iotza
was sorry, for Sandu had been kind, and never spoken a rude word to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to leave you,&rdquo; said Sandu, and he felt as if
his heart was breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with you,&rdquo; replied they, and holding out their
hands they accompanied him outside.</p>
<p>Iotza went a little way with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandu, listen; I cannot bear not to tell you, but I know the
mistress and you, and I know you want to go and say good-bye to her.
Don&rsquo;t go, listen to me: it was not the master, it was she who
said you were to be dismissed. Don&rsquo;t go, it is better not to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu made no reply.</p>
<p>They went a few steps farther together and parted. The nearer he
drew to Master Dinu&rsquo;s house, the more he longed to enter. He felt
as though some one were urging him to go in. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he was quite near the door Master Dinu came out into the
street. When he saw Sandu he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going, master, but I wanted to take leave of the
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the mistress is not at home let me tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu bent his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, master.<span class="corr" id="xd19e4504"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;May God be with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With slow and heavy step Sandu took the road to the market-place. At
the corner he stopped. He turned his head and looked back along the
street towards Master Dinu&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>He had crossed the square and was on the bridge when he met Nitza
Burencea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Sandu, have you left? Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandu, like a person awakened out of a trance, with his eyes
fastened dreamily upon the distant horizon, answered in a troubled
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go out into the world!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Bird of Ill Omen</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By I. Al.
Bratescu-Voineshti</span></p>
<p>Conu Costache had one of the pleasantest faces in the town.</p>
<p>Men of the same age as himself said he was nearly seventy years old;
but a life free from care, a comfortable fortune, a wife as loving as a
sister, two children who were getting on well, and, above all, his own
kindly nature, had kept him so healthy, quick of movement and clear of
mind, that one would not have given him fifty years.</p>
<p>He told stories with a charm and humour that gathered an audience
round him whenever he opened his mouth; and as he had travelled much
abroad, and was also a sportsman, he knew every kind of amusing
anecdote.</p>
<p>This man, who was as good as new bread, always smiling, whose person
seemed to radiate joy, became acrimonious and impatient every time his
game of Preference went badly; it was the one and only, but the daily
game of cards he played. He did not get angry out of
stinginess&mdash;he was not a miser; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>on the contrary, he
was open-handed, that was his nature.</p>
<p>If it happened that he &ldquo;entered&rdquo; twice in succession, or
if he got irritated with his partners, he grew furious. Everything
seemed wrong to him; the jam was sour, the coffee too sweet, the water
too cold, the lamp too dim, the chalk was not sharp enough; he shouted
at the boy who served him; he changed his chair because it squeaked; he
hammered upon the table with his fists until the candlesticks jumped;
he looked daggers over his spectacles at anyone who made a joke&mdash;I
assure you, he was in a vile temper, as vile a temper as a man could be
in, when he had no other place in which to give vent to it.</p>
<p>His partners knew him, and were aware that five minutes after the
game was over he would become once more kind, amiable, and amusing Conu
Costache.</p>
<p>If you were sitting near him when he was playing Preference, you
should get up the first time he &ldquo;entered&rdquo;; shouldn&rsquo;t
wait for him to say to you: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get away, my good
fellow; you spoil my luck!&rdquo; One day, after two
&ldquo;entries,&rdquo; he said to a person with whom he had only just
become acquainted and who would not move away from his side:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but I believe in birds of ill omen. This game
is a question of faces. I can scarcely compose my own face; I certainly
cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>compose yours. Kindly move a little farther off!
Thank you. Don&rsquo;t be offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever since that day, the onlookers at the game have been given the
name of birds of ill omen, and they swarmed in the room where Conu
Costache played; if the game went well he was affable and they listened
to him with pleasure&mdash;if the game went badly, they moved away from
him and made fun of his ill humour.</p>
<p>One evening the Prefect gave a party. The young people danced in the
drawing-room; their elders assembled in the other rooms; Conu Costache
sat at a table playing Preference with three other people; among them
was the attorney, a cunning player with a special talent for making him
lose his temper; a large audience had gathered round.</p>
<p>Conu Costache was losing: he was angry, but controlled
himself&mdash;he could not give vent to his annoyance, for there were
ladies present. Conu and his friends were playing in the middle of the
room; he had barely scored six, and had entered the pool with
thirteen.</p>
<p>At this moment an old lady approached. She was a Moldavian, the
mother of Dr. Ionashcu. She took a chair, seated herself by Conu
Costache with the calm serenity of the aged, who neither see nor hear
well.</p>
<p>There she remained.</p>
<p>From time to time she gently put a question to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>Conu
Costache; it had the same effect upon his agitation as does oil upon a
fire of coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful it must be at your country-house now, Mr.
Costache!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, Mrs. Raluca,&rdquo; he replied, forcing himself to
smile&mdash;and chalking himself another eighteen in the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you often go there, as it is so close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to-day, Mrs. Raluca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No words can describe the contrast between the placidity with which
Mrs. Raluca told her beads, and the fury with which Conu Costache
shuffled his cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a good harvest, Mr. Costache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&mdash;g&mdash;good, Mrs. Raluca,&rdquo; he replied,
thrusting both hands inside the neck of his shirt to loosen the
collar.</p>
<p>The game began, the attorney played below the ace, Conu Costache
named the suit for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a good road along there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;y&mdash;yes, Mrs. Raluca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wonder his handkerchief did not rub the skin off his
forehead, he mopped it with such vigour. His partners and the onlookers
shook with laughter; the attorney did not give way at all, he saw how
furious he was; he bid with nothing in his hand, and passed just in
time to make him &ldquo;enter&rdquo; a second time.</p>
<p>And at this moment Mrs. Raluca&rsquo;s questions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>fell
one after the other as fast as the beads of a rosary. She did not hear
the rustling of the cards nor the choking in Conu Costache&rsquo;s
throat, she did not see his misery nor the amusement of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they have cut down the lovely wood on the right,
haven&rsquo;t they, Mr. Costache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&mdash;th&mdash;they have cut it down, Mrs. Raluca,&rdquo;
he answered, gazing at the ceiling and pressing his temples between his
hands.</p>
<p>He bid and came in, said &ldquo;Play&rdquo;&mdash;and found two
clubs in the talon which he did not want. Such a collection of cards
you have never seen; it might have been done on purpose. If you had
tried to arrange them so, you could not have done it. It was a regular
&ldquo;walk-over&rdquo;: one cut four honours, the other cut the
spades, and out of the eight games won five.</p>
<p>All he cut was an ace, and a pair. He put forty-eight in the
pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the little lake still lies on the left, doesn&rsquo;t it,
Mr. Costache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St&mdash;st&mdash;still, Mrs. Raluca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a small brush he violently effaced the whole row of his stakes
chalked on the cloth and wrote down a total of ninety-four in huge
figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must ask you, the inn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conu Costache turned his chair right round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Raluca, to-morrow afternoon my wife and I are going to
our country-house&mdash;we will come and pick you up. In this way you
will see <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>how they cut down the wood on the right; you
will see how the storks walk by the lake on the left; you will see how
they have repaired the bridges; you will see how they have renovated
the inn at the cross-gates; you will see what a nice house Ionitza
Andrescu from Ulmi has built; you will see what big reservoirs the
Aurora factory have erected by the road....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Raluca understood and took her departure, telling her beads as
she went, but even when she had passed into the third room Conu
Costache still continued, while the others were convulsed with
laughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see how illegible the figures on the 76 milestone
have become; you will see how the boys have broken the insulators on
the telegraph posts by throwing stones at them; you will see how the
geese hiss when the carriage passes by; you will
see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning back to his partners, who laughed till the tears ran
down their cheeks, he groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible bird of ill omen!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">Irinel</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">By B. Delavrancea</span></p>
<p>When my parents died, both in the same year, I was quite small; I
think I must have been about seven years old.</p>
<p>I wanted to cry over them both, for I loved them both, but when I
approached their coffin I was not alone.</p>
<p>You must know that my father left a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>There were many people about him who could not endure him.</p>
<p>There was talk of a will.</p>
<p>There was one member of the family about whom my father said:
&ldquo;It is so long since he crossed our threshold that I do not
understand why he is so offended with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unkind to tell you: it was his brother and my uncle, a very
good man, with only one fault&mdash;he had lost his entire fortune at
cards. I found among my father&rsquo;s papers a quantity of his
I.O.U.&rsquo;s, beautifully signed with flourishes, but unpaid.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>I approached the coffin; I was sure that I should weep as no one had
ever wept before.</p>
<p>My home without my parents!</p>
<p>Some one took me by the hand, and said to me as he kissed me on both
cheeks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, Iorgu, cry, Iorgu, for those who will never
return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was he! The uncle of the promissory notes!</p>
<p>Just when my eyes ought to have been full of tears, I caught sight
of him, and when I looked round me and saw the other people, when I met
so many pairs of eyes, then&mdash;I was ashamed and could not cry. Oh,
it is a terrible thing to feel ashamed to cry when one is
sorrowing!</p>
<p>Do you see how shy I am? Have you grasped it? It is difficult to
understand. It is difficult, because you, readers, are different. Not
one of you are the same as I am.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>I was so good and timid that, when I completed my twenty-first year,
I did not want to leave the guardianship of my eldest uncle, my
mother&rsquo;s brother, a very gentle man like myself, and very shy
like my mother.</p>
<p>It makes me laugh. Is it likely I shall tell you an untruth? Why
should I? I don&rsquo;t ask you anything, you don&rsquo;t ask me
anything. Why should I lie?</p>
<p>But it is true that I have not told you quite openly why I did not
ask for an account of my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>minority, and why I stayed in that
house, which was as white as milk&mdash;especially on moonlight
nights&mdash;with its balcony, its oak staircase, its pillars with
flowered capitals and wreaths round their centres.</p>
<p>Did I like the house? Yes.</p>
<p>Did I love my uncle who had managed my affairs? Yes. Was I ashamed,
directly I came of age, to demand an account as though I doubted his
honesty? Yes. Anything besides? Was there anything else that kept me in
bondage?</p>
<p>If you had looked at me a little askance, I should have blushed and
replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And if you were to look at me even now when
I have already grown many white hairs, I should tell you like a guilty
child: &ldquo;No, it is not true that I loved so much the house in
which I grew up, or the uncle with whom I lived. There was something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some one there besides a cousin of the same age as myself,
besides my uncle&mdash;my aunt was dead&mdash;besides the house, and a
long-haired dog. There was somebody else!</p>
<p>Ah! This sort of somebody has reformed many a <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e4679" title=
"Source: ne&rsquo;er-do-weel">ne&rsquo;er-do-well</span>, has dazzled
many a shy man, has turned many business men into poets, has shaken
many a professor to the depths of his being, blowing away his system
like the threads of a spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>No doubt it was a very fascinating &ldquo;somebody&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>who made you stay in tutelage twenty-four hours
after you had reached your twenty-first year and come into 15,000
lei.</p>
<p>I think you have guessed the secret which I have hidden till
now.</p>
<p>Oh, women, women! What do they care for the timid or the
philosopher?</p>
<p>Neither innocence nor philosophy can resist a light step and a pair
of eyes which sparkle and glow and pierce through the coldest, most
selfish, most impenetrable heart.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Was it not the same Irinel, with whom I once played childish games?
Was she not the same wild tomboy with her frocks down to her knees
only, and her white stockings that became green by the evening? Was she
not the same little demon who threw her books into the veranda on her
return from school, and put both arms round my neck to make me give her
a ride on my back?</p>
<p>The child turned into the woman, and instead of the gentle eyes with
their extreme innocence in which I lost myself as in a boundless
expanse, there shone two devilish fires in whose light I saw an
explanation of life with all its sea of pleasures and emotions.</p>
<p>And now Irinel used to take me by the hand. She was fifteen years
old; for some time her hand had felt different&mdash;warmer, softer,
more I don&rsquo;t know what, when I took it in mine. Her gaiety
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>was no longer even and continual as of old; she
no longer talked quickly and incessantly.</p>
<p>And if I said to her: &ldquo;Irinel, do you think it will rain
to-day?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irinel, there are only two weeks before the
long vacation begins, shall you be pleased, as you used to be, when we
go to Slanic?&rdquo; Irinel remained silent, looking straight in front
of her, and I am sure that at that moment she saw nothing&mdash;trees,
houses, and sky disappeared as though in a thick mist.</p>
<p>This silence surprised and disquieted me, and I said to her in a low
voice, almost as though I were guilty of something wrong:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, you are scarcely back from school and you are bored
already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exaggerated gaiety was her immediate reply; she laughed, and
talked, and told little anecdotes which she began and left unfinished,
especially about life at school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said to me in a quick, loud
voice, &ldquo;what a letter one of my friends showed me. Only I read
it, and another girl and her sister, and it seems to me she showed it
to some others. I nearly died of laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Irinel began to laugh, and laughed and laughed until the tears
ran down her rosy cheeks. Then sighing and laughing she began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote to her, trembling, of stars, two only, which burnt
and spoke to him. How can the stars he talks about burn? Are they bits
of coal? How <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>can stars speak? I don&rsquo;t understand. After
that came ice, thawing, marble, a bed of fire, a monastery,
suicide&mdash;Ah! pauvre Marie! Indeed, I was sorry for her, poor girl!
Many a time we put our arms round each other&rsquo;s necks and kissed
each other. We kissed each other and began to cry. You must know,
Iorgu, that we kept nothing from each other. Every Monday she read me a
letter on which could be seen traces of big tears, and I, after I had
controlled myself sufficiently not to burst out laughing over those
&lsquo;two twin stars which burn and speak,&rsquo; had to prepare to
cry, and, believe me, I cried with all my heart. <i lang="fr">Pauvre
ch&eacute;rie!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irinel was ready to cry after laughing with such enjoyment, but,
when she noticed that I kept my eyes cast down and listened in silence
as though I were offended, she asked me with malicious irony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, do you think it will rain to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such scenes took place early in the morning: Sunday was a day of
torture for me. All day Irinel said &ldquo;If you please&rdquo; to me.
She embroidered or played the piano instead of our walking about the
yard and garden. All day I felt the terrible anger of a very shy person
with &ldquo;those two stars which speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three years I lived this life of daring dreams during the week,
of fear and misery on Sunday, of wonderful plans put off from day to
day, and concealed with an hypocrisy possessed only by the timid and
innocent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>During the last year, after a vacation passed at Slanic, I made up
my mind.</p>
<p>The day she went back to school we hardly dared kiss each other.
What cold kisses! We neither of us looked at the other. I remember I
looked at the sofa, and it seemed to me as though my lips had touched
the hard yellow material instead of those firm, rosy cheeks which were
to me a fearful joy.</p>
<p>I made up my mind, and I am sure that no one could have come to a
more heroic decision.</p>
<p>To give myself courage, during the first night I thought out the
scene which should take place the following Sunday without fail. I did
not sleep all night; in the intense darkness I saw the garden, I saw
Irinel, I heard myself, I heard her.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The cocks crew. I was lying at full length, my face uppermost, my
eyes shut. I was perspiring from the boldness which I had shown during
the scene which was running in my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, will you come and walk in the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>merci</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not do, we must go for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She understood that I had decided to say something important to her.
Such courage impressed and compelled.</p>
<p>The cocks crew. It was midnight. It was pouring; flashes of
lightning, like serpents of light, shone for a second through my
curtains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, you must come with me. Don&rsquo;t you see what a
beautiful day it is? I have discovered a bunch of ripe grapes which I
have kept for you all the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>merci</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for you not to come. I have made up my mind
to tell you something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; replied Irinel, and turned her eyes upon
me.<a id="xd19e4770" name="xd19e4770"></a></p>
<p>Who could bear such a bright light? I looked down, but revolted by
such cowardice I felt the courage of a hero, and lifting my head I
replied to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all my life I had never commanded anyone. I was ordering her!</p>
<p>It was pitch dark; it was raining outside. I turned towards the
wall. I closed my eyes. It was light. It was a beautiful Sunday. And
still full of that courage I said to her once more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I took her by the hand. From now on my heart almost ceased to
beat. I told her all I had wanted to say to her for two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, Irinel, I love you! Do you love me? Why are you
silent? Why do you look down? Tell me, shall I leave the house where I
have watched you growing up under my eyes, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>We embraced each other; we kissed each other. It was over.</p>
<p>Lord! How brave men are when they are in love!</p>
<p>I grew cold all over when I reflected that this scene had not yet
taken place, but was still to come. I sank down under my quilt afraid
of such courage.</p>
<p>It began to grow light. I went off to sleep gradually, rehearsing
this heroic scene:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, will you come for a walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>merci</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cannot be, you must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The next day I woke up about ten o&rsquo;clock. My uncle asked me in
his kind, calm voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, are you not well that you got up so late
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I, feeling myself in fault, replied, embarrassed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;a book&mdash;I went to sleep late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My ears were burning as though I had held them against a hot
stove.</p>
<p>The veranda seemed to be giving way under me. Do you know, at that
moment a thought crossed my mind that overwhelmed me? Irinel was only
Irinel, but, with my uncle, what courage I should need! How would he,
an old man of pious habits, regard in his old age a marriage within the
prohibited degree among members of his own family?</p>
<p>Why did he stand in front of me? Why did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>he
look at me like that? He understood me and was appraising me! His look
spoke, though his lips most certainly did not move. I heard the words
passing through his mind as distinctly as though some one had whispered
in my ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could have believed, nephew, that you would have
turned my child&rsquo;s head! What would your mother say were she alive
to see this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why did not my uncle turn away from me? Was he looking at me or
elsewhere? What else was there to see? I do not know if the fault was
great, but the judge was cruel. And my judge grew bigger, like a Titan,
like a wall between me and Irinel. In my ears there rang what I am
convinced was the sentence he had secretly passed on me: &ldquo;What a
depraved youth! The old are passing away, and with them disappear the
old moral ideas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was ready to sink under my chair. My uncle said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, you have not had any coffee. It seems to me you are
not well, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What irony! Were his words more gentle than before? Useless thought!
I understood him. God defend you from a good man who disapproves of
you. It&rsquo;s bad enough to feel oneself guilty before a good and
upright man.</p>
<p>Why was punishment for mankind invented? Punishment is the reward of
sin. I could have wished that my uncle would pronounce his sentence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>of punishment. But no, he has taken me prisoner,
he has judged me and, instead of punishing me, he stoops to give me
coffee and two rolls. In all my life I had never experienced a greater
agony.</p>
<p>No doubt he had seen us walking silently together, not gaily as we
used to do. He understood why Irinel stayed in the house on one or two
Sundays. Of course he knew why I did not go to sleep till early dawn,
and who knows, he might have heard me calling in my dreams:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irinel, Irinel, I love you! Do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What would my uncle think of his daughter married to his
sister&rsquo;s son? It would mean asking for a dispensation. Would it
not be turning such a religious man into an object of derision in his
old age? And for what reason? Just through the caprice of a boy whom he
had brought up and cared for.</p>
<p>Irinel and I had grown up together more like brother and sister than
cousins! If there had only been a question of the civil right! But the
laws of the Church! How could one trample them underfoot?</p>
<p>Throughout the week, early in the morning, at night and through the
day, at meals and during school hours, this thought occupied my
mind!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible! It is impossible! I wonder that I did not
see that sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>About six o&rsquo;clock on Saturday our old carriage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>turned into the courtyard; inside was my uncle
and by him sat Irinel. From the oak steps of the veranda I watched the
white hair and the golden curls and, scarcely able to control my tears,
I said to myself: &ldquo;It is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irinel sprang from the carriage and came up to me. She was happy. We
kissed each other, but, believe me, she seemed to kiss in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Iorgu? You are very pale. You are
thinner, or does it only seem so to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could answer her my uncle hastened, <i>hastened</i> to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with Iorgu. It
seems to me he is ill, but he will not say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! You don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with me, uncle? You
don&rsquo;t know what is the matter? It seems to you I am ill? I do not
want to tell you? Do you say what is the matter with you? You are a
good man, but what a hypocrite&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He thinks I do not understand him.</p>
<p>To Irinel I say gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter, Irinel. But you, are you
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it went on&mdash;nearly a whole year of depression.</p>
<p>Why should I tell you that I grew thinner and paler, that I often
shivered, and with secret pleasure, exaggerated a little cough when I
walked in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>garden with Irinel? You have seen so many thin
and pale men, and you have read so many novels in which consumptive
lovers either shoot themselves or throw themselves into the sea, so
that if I told you that I grew thinner, that I took to playing
billiards, that I began to drink, and that once I drank three half
bottles in succession, you would only yawn.</p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable in the love and depression of a nervous
person. Who would remain, even for an instant, with a man who suffers
in silence? And I kept silence from St. Mary&rsquo;s day to St.
Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, uncle; no, dear Irinel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the momentous day arrived! Irinel finished the last year of
her education. On the 20th of June she left school for good.</p>
<p>That very day she asked my uncle abruptly to what watering-place we
were going, and on hearing came into my room.</p>
<p>Stretched upon my bed, I was reading the wonderful discourse of
Cogalniceanu&rsquo;s, printed in front of the &ldquo;Chronicles.&rdquo;
I made up my mind to read law and study literature and history.</p>
<p>When I saw her I jumped up. She whirled round on one foot, and her
gown seemed like a big convolvulus; and after this revolution she
stopped in front of me, laughing and clapping her hands. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>She
made me a curtsy as she daintily lifted up her skirt on either side
between two fingers, and asked me coyly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon cher cousin, can you guess where we are going to this
summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Irinel,&rdquo; I replied, exaggerating the cough which
was becoming more and more of a silly habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give me if I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after once more whirling round while her gown swept across my
feet, and laughing and clapping, she asked me most sedately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kiss my hand with respect, like a grown-up
person&rsquo;s, if I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Irinel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cough again played its part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you must kiss my hand first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand to me, which I kissed sadly, but with
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that one, Irinel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mehadia! To Mehadia! Won&rsquo;t it be beautiful? I am
bored with Slanic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran about the house so quickly that her petticoats worked up
above her knees. I blushed; she blushed; then breaking into a silvery
laugh she threw herself upon me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will dance a polka. I will sing. I will be gentleman; I
will steer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I heard my uncle calling her: &ldquo;Irinel! Irinel! Where are
you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>She disappeared in a second.</p>
<p>I threw myself on my bed. I took up the &ldquo;Chronicles,&rdquo;
but instead of reading I began to think. &ldquo;Irinel! Irinel!&rdquo;
The first Irinel was quick, severe, malicious, the second one was
lingering, much softer, almost caressing. Of course he had meant to
reassure her, he had wanted to deceive me. He thought to make me
believe he had meant nothing. But what did that &ldquo;<i>Where</i> are
you?&rdquo; signify?</p>
<p>I understood from the way in which he had said
&ldquo;<i>where</i>&rdquo; that there lay the real drift of the
question. He had not anything to say to her, but he very much wanted to
know &ldquo;<i>where</i>&rdquo; she was. In other words, was she
perchance with me in my room? Such espionage was humiliating for an
orphan whose whole life he had directed, and whose fortune he had
controlled, because he had the right to say to him with a single word,
by a single look: &ldquo;This is how I reward an ungrateful person, a
youth who has no regard for the old men who are soon to pass away,
burying with them the moral customs of this country.&rdquo; That
&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; was as clear as noonday. Do you suppose he
did not know where she was?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! An orphan must not fall in love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what other thoughts I had. The door of the room
opened; Irinel stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>How great an unhappiness it is to see happiness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>standing on the threshold, and to know it will
not cross; that it will remain yonder, so near and yet so far!</p>
<p>Irinel crossed the threshold; she came up to me. I realized that she
had crossed the threshold, but still my happiness remained outside. I
understood the old man had sent her back in order to deceive me, and
that she had guessed nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what Father has just told me? A guest is coming
to us at the festival of St. Peter. A big merchant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did that mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he say anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; but yes, he did. We are to kill our fattest chicken
and the house is to be put into the most spick and span order, for our
guest is an important merchant, a deputy, elderly, and I don&rsquo;t
know what all and what else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After teasing me and laughing at me because I coughed just as the
girls at school did to make the doctor prescribe iron and old wine, but
more particularly old wine than iron, Irinel left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! It&rsquo;s lucky he is old. Supposing he had been a
young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>On St. Peter&rsquo;s day I rose in such a state of anxiety that I
started at every sound. Has it not been known for old men to lose their
heads and marry girls of eighteen?</p>
<p>For three hours I wandered about the grounds. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>I
waited for this rival with the same impatience with which I once waited
for Irinel to come quickly from school. Am I deceiving myself or not?
The same sensations, identically the same, were present with me,
waiting thus for the object of my hatred as when I waited for her I
loved. I wanted to see him as soon as possible; for a second; just to
know him; to find out who he was.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock a carriage drew up in front of the door. Some
one got out. When I saw him I began to laugh. He was very feeble, he
was very old. No doubt he was smart with his black coat and red tie. I
greeted him with respect, I might almost say with affection, and then,
sorry at having felt hatred for such an old man, with such snowwhite
hair, I went quietly into the garden. I turned down one of the paths.
How sad and drear do the most beautiful natural surroundings become
when they are reflected by a sad and lonely heart? What indifference
everywhere!</p>
<p>The garden gate was opened rather hastily as though the wind had
forced it. Irinel appeared. She looked all round, then, seeing me, she
flew towards me. The breeze which she made by her flight fluttered her
thin gown of white batiste with black spots.</p>
<p>She was pale. She took my hand. Her own trembled. She tried to
speak, and said several times:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait while I get my breath&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then she became silent and looked at me. Oh, what a look! Her eyes
flashed sparks. Their blue depths seemed to me like an incomprehensible
ocean, tempest driven, without bottom, without boundaries. I looked
down, overwhelmed by an inexplicable fear, by a powerful emotion. I
noticed my boots, and I thought to myself: &ldquo;Have they cleaned my
boots to-day or not? Of course, they must have. Don&rsquo;t they clean
them every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, do you know why that old man has come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered her, with a stupid calm.</p>
<p>Had they cleaned my boots? Perhaps the dew was still on the
grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iorgu, do you know what Father said to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Put on your foulard gown.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your foulard gown? The one I like so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know why he wanted me to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She trembled.</p>
<p>I continued, as I took out my handkerchief and flicked the dust from
one of my boots:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know. Isn&rsquo;t to-day a great
festival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she replied as she withdrew the hand I was
holding, &ldquo;you understand nothing! What an indifferent and
non-understanding man you are!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indifferent? I understood everything from her look and her emotion,
and with a calmness which I was certainly far from feeling I bent down
and dusted the other boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man has come, Irinel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I said,
glancing at her for a moment.</p>
<p>She was white, her lower lip quivered, the light in her eyes had
darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man has come, Irinel. What then? He will dine with
us? All the better. We shall be a bigger party at table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was it I speaking? There were only she and I in the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man has come, has come. Alas!&rdquo; she replied,
covering her eyes with both her hands. &ldquo;The old man has come and
some one is going to leave this house! He has&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irinel began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A son who is an engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engineer? Has he learnt engineering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>he has learnt engineering</i>!&rdquo; Irinel replied
angrily, and uncovered her crimson cheeks. &ldquo;Yes, he has learnt
en-gi-neer-ing, and some one is going to leave this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched how she stood in the doorway, and then crossed it lightly
as she wiped away her tears on a clean corner of her gown. I looked
long after her, then I threw myself face upwards under one of the
fruit-trees. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nature was full of life! The apple-trees bent their great boughs;
the sparrows chattered, some of them were fluttering their wings,
others were collecting into groups preparing for a fierce fight. Little
patches of sunlight played upon my face. When I felt two rows of tears
trickling into my ears, I jumped to my feet, I gazed towards the door,
and said gently, full of a profound melancholy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is going to leave this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The next day I showed my uncle a faked recommendation, in writing,
from a doctor ordering me to Bourboule under pretext of a serious
affection of the left lung.</p>
<p>I pass rapidly over this episode. I kissed my uncle&rsquo;s hand and
Irinel. Irinel!</p>
<p>Only when I was crossing the frontier and looking from the open
window of the train at the Hungarian landscape lying stretched out
before me, did I begin to wonder. Supposing she had not looked at me so
intently! A searching look paralysed me. Supposing she had asked me
what it was I wanted to say to her? Such shyness is a form of madness.
But what courage I should have wanted! How could I have convinced my
uncle? Was not Irinel like my sister? Ah, no! It was impossible! It was
impossible!</p>
<p>The train, which was puffing along, gave a whistle that echoed
through the country. A few tears fell through the window, and seeking
with my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>eyes the country from which I had come, and the
direction where lay the house and garden in which I had grown up so
happily, I gave a wave with my hand, and said sighing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Irinel!&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
